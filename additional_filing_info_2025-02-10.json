This filing included revisions to the Quantum Home 2.0 model, updating factors such as Roof Square Footage, Tree Overhang, Insurance Score, Auto Bodily Injury Limit, and Travelers Auto Policy. The Company introduced two new variables, Roof Condition Score and Presence of Zinc Staining. The filing was supported by a detailed review of model assumptions, data sources, variable selection, and model validation.\n\nTravelers utilized data from third-party vendors such as LexisNexis, Precisely, ISO, Axcion, EASI, NOAA, TransUnion, Equifax, and Nearmap for modeling and validation purposes. Nearmap's Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was used for semantic segmentation to identify roof discoloration, tree overhang, and other structural features from aerial imagery. The model demonstrated validation accuracy exceeding 80% for most classifications and specificity greater than 85%.\n\nThe Company provided explanations on variable selection and model validation processes, emphasizing the statistical justification for included variables and the reliability of the model's predictions. Lift charts for different perils and out-of-sample performance metrics were also detailed to support the filing's predictive capabilities.\n\nUltimately, the actuarial approval recommended the approval of the filing after reviewing the methodology, assumptions, and validation results provided by Travelers.",
