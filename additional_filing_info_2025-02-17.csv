The DOI raised multiple objections to Encompass's filing, primarily seeking clarifications on:
- The number of policyholders impacted by each change.
- The rationale and consequences (e.g., premium adjustments) of the proposed underwriting modifications.
- Specific queries regarding the addition of loss history details and reasons behind certain ineligibility criteria.

Encompass responded by:
- Confirming the total premium amount for its book of business as $41,281,363.
- Pausing all non-renewals for the 885 policies initially planned for non-renewal due to wildfire moratoriums imposed by the Commissioner.
- Clarifying that no rate adjustments are expected from the underwriting changes, asserting rate neutrality.
- Providing detailed explanations for each objection, including the methodology behind determining sufficient rates and the decision to adjust wildfire risk scores without changing the wildfire score vendor.

**Conclusion and Next Steps:**
Encompass Insurance Company is actively addressing the DOI's objections by providing comprehensive responses and adjusting its proposed changes in response to regulatory feedback. The company emphasizes its commitment to managing wildfire risks without impacting overall premium structures adversely. The filing remains under DOI review, awaiting final approval or further regulatory action.

**Competitive Insights:**
Encompass’s proactive adjustments in underwriting guidelines reflect a strategic move to enhance risk management, particularly concerning wildfire exposures in California.

### **Rate Development:**
- **Basis of Rates:** Since Metromile does not have credible data for the new program, the rates and rating algorithm were developed based on data from Lemonade Insurance Company's approved filings in Colorado, specifically the filing effective 11/04/2023.
- **Enhancements:** Metromile has made several enhancements to the program, including:
  - Revised all peril deductible factors based on a competitive analysis.
  - Integrated the Loss Cost Multiplier and Loss Cost Modification Factor into the base rate.
  - Included personal property at replacement cost in the base rate.
  - Refined base rates to vary by Census Tract.
  - Removed loyalty credit factors.
  - Restructured the bundle credit to align with Metromile's product offerings.
  - Removed the high-risk dog surcharge.
  - Adjusted limits and coverage options for various endorsements.

### **Rate Structure:**
- **Base Rate:** The base rate varies by Census Tract and ISO Territory, with adjustments based on factors such as protection class, coverage limits, tier, all peril deductible, type of residence, bundle discount, one-family dwelling, vacant dwelling, protective devices, and building code effectiveness grading.
- **Rate Tables:** Detailed rate tables were provided, including rates for various coverage limits and options, ensuring a comprehensive and competitive pricing structure.

### **Supporting Documents:**
- **Actuarial Memorandum:** Provides detailed support for the development of the proposed rates, including exhibits on base rate offset support, proposed base rates, and expense and profit provisions.
- **Competitive Market Study:** A study comparing Metromile's proposed premiums with those of competitors such as Lemonade, Assurant, Sutton National, and Trisura in four major Colorado counties: El Paso, Denver, Arapahoe, and Douglas.
- **Form A:** A rate, rule, and loss cost filing submission form detailing the proposed rates and their impact.
- **Confidentiality Index:** Lists items submitted confidentially to support the rate development.

### **Filing Status:**
- The filing was initially submitted and reviewed by the Colorado Department of Insurance. After initial inquiries and adjustments made by Metromile, the company requested to withdraw the filing on 02/11/2025 to allow time for a deeper review and necessary improvements before resubmission.

### **Key Points:**
- **Withdrawal Reason:** Metromile believes that further review and potential improvements are necessary to enhance the program for the benefit of Colorado consumers.

language will have on our future underwriting experience.   The changes detailed in this filing reflect our best efforts to
recognize our actuarially suggested income needs and have premiums that are as competitive as possible.
We do not rely solely on rate activity to achieve our objective of continued financial solidity.  We also concentrate on continued
improvements in the way we service the business we write.  These improvements range from internal expense controls to
ongoing enhancements in the loss settlement process.  We also invest and participate in many loss prevention and control
activities.  Attached is an exhibit that outlines some of these activities.
A filing fee is not submitted since our state of domicile does not require a filing fee for rate and rule filings.
We request your approval of this filing to be effective December 15, 2024 for new business and February 15, 2024 for

**Filing Overview:**
State Farm Fire and Casualty Company submitted a Rate and Rule filing (SERFF Tracking #: SFMA-134057170) to the Connecticut Insurance Department on April 10, 2024, concerning their independent Connecticut Homeowners Program (Product HO-46763). The filing requests approval for revised rates effective February 15, 2025, for new business and April 15, 2025, for renewals. Notably, the overall rate level change is neutral at 0.0%, indicating no adjustment to premium rates across the board.

**Key Changes and Enhancements:**
1. **Introduction of By-Peril Rating:** The filing introduces a by-peril rating approach for Homeowners policies, allowing premiums to be calculated separately for each covered peril (e.g., fire, wind/hail, crime). This method aims to enhance accuracy and fairness in premium determination based on specific risk exposures.
   
2. **Location Rating Factors (LRF) and Construction Classifications:** Adjustments have been made to the LRF and construction classifications to better reflect the risk associated with different geographic zones and building types. Updated factors are accessible via State Farm’s internal rate grid.

3. **Fixed Expense Constant:** A new fixed expense constant of $143 is introduced for each Homeowners policy, intended to cover administrative and operational costs.

4. **Optional Coverages and Discounts:** 
   - **Home Alert Protection:** Discounts for fire and burglary prevention measures, such as alarm systems, have been revised.
   - **Home/AUTO Discount:** Enhanced discounts for policyholders who also hold a private passenger automobile policy with State Farm.
   - **Loyal Customer Discount:** Adjusted premiums based on the number of consecutive months insured with State Farm.
   - **Wind Mitigation and Energy Efficiency:** Updated discounts for properties with fortified structures and energy-efficient upgrades.

5. **Deductibles and Loss Settlement Provisions:** The filing details various deductible options and loss settlement provisions, including specific adjustments for hurricane deductibles based on dwelling location and construction standards.

**Correspondence and Objections:**
Throughout the filing process, the Connecticut Insurance Department raised several objections, primarily concerning:
- **Wind/Hail Exclusion References:** Recommendations to remove misleading references implying the availability of wind/hail exclusions.
- **Modeling and Actuarial Practices:** Requests for detailed explanations of the modeling techniques, weight of evidence (WoE) coding, and adherence to actuarial standards to ensure fairness and avoidance of unintentional bias.
- **Effective Date Revisions:** Adjustments to the effective dates of the rate changes were requested and subsequently approved.

State Farm addressed these objections through detailed response letters, committing to revise manuals, provide additional documentation, and ensure compliance with all regulatory requirements. Additionally, State Farm requested confidentiality for certain proprietary documents, which the Department is in the process of reviewing.

**Impact and Implementation:**
- **Written Premiums:** The filing projects a written premium of approximately $180.39 million, with a slight negative impact of $304 attributed to the rate adjustments.
- **Policyholders Affected:** Around 145,762 policyholders will be impacted by these changes.
- **Implementation Timeline:** To facilitate the smooth transition to the new rates, State Farm plans to commence implementation procedures by October 11, 2024.

**Conclusion:**
This Rate and Rule filing signifies State Farm’s efforts to refine their Homeowners insurance offerings in Connecticut through enhanced rating methodologies, improved operational efficiencies, and a focus on both competitive pricing and robust risk management. With a neutral rate change, the primary benefits lie in the structural and procedural advancements aimed at better aligning premiums with actual risk profiles and fostering long-term financial stability.","The filing from State Farm Fire and Casualty Company is a rate and rule filing for its Homeowners Program in Connecticut, with the following key points:

5. **Response to State Objections:**

**1. ** **Filing Overview**

- **State:** Kansas
- **Filing Type:** Form/Rule
- **SERFF Tracking Number:** SFMA-134239055

- **Effective Date:** April 15, 2025 (for both new and renewal business)

**2. ** **Purpose of the Filing**
State Farm is implementing changes to its HO-47509 homeowners insurance product in Kansas to manage exposure to Severe Convective Storms, specifically targeting high-risk wind and hail areas. The primary change involves making the **Roof Surfaces Payment Schedule Endorsement (Form HO-2789)** mandatory for policyholders with specific roof types in designated high-risk zip codes.

**3. ** **Key Changes Introduced**
- **Mandatory Endorsement:** 
  - **Form HO-2789** will transition from optional to mandatory for policyholders in specified high-risk areas.
  - Requirements apply to homes with architectural shingle roofing that is 10 years or older.
  
- **Roof Surfaces Payment Schedule:**
  - **Loss Settlement Reduction:** The endorsement limits the loss settlement for roof surfaces to a percentage of the replacement or repair costs based on the roof's age and material.
  - **Payment Schedule Details:** A structured schedule provides specific reduction percentages tied to the roof's age (ranging from 0% for roofs replaced within the current year to 33% for roofs 19 years or older) and roof material (e.g., shingles, wood, metal).
  
- **Premium Adjustments:**
  - **Reduction in Premiums:** Corresponding premium reductions are applied based on the roof's age and type. For example, a roof replaced six years prior with metal composition would receive a 5% premium reduction.
  - **Mandatory Areas:** Premium adjustments are designed to reflect the increased risk in high-hail and windstorm areas.

**4. ** **Geographical Impact**
- **Affected Zip Codes:** Approximately 2000 new business customers annually in designated high-risk areas across numerous Kansas counties.
- **High-Risk Areas Include:** Counties such as Barton, Butler, Chase, and others, with partial impact on certain zip codes within these counties.

**5. ** **Regulatory Interaction and Objections**
- **Objections from Kansas Department of Insurance (DOI):**
  - **Form Usage Clarifications:** DOI required State Farm to update the forms usage rule to specify roof types and high-risk locations where the endorsement becomes mandatory.
  - **Supporting Documentation:** Requests for detailed lists of impacted zip codes, redlined documents showing changes to previously approved forms/rates, and explanations on policyholder communications.
  - **Policyholder Notices:** Instructions to provide a clear, 1-page summary explaining coverage reductions to affected policyholders, to be distributed via mail and email at least 30 days before policy renewal.
  
- **State Farm’s Responses:**
  - **Clarifications Provided:** State Farm confirmed no changes to the wording of existing endorsements or rates but clarified the shift from optional to mandatory usage in high-risk areas.
  - **Documentation Supplied:** Submitted lists of impacted zip codes (KS_RSPS_Zips.xlsx & KS_RSPS_Zips.pdf), relocated the Rate Manual Page to the appropriate schedule tab, and engaged in multiple conference calls with DOI representatives.
  - **Policy Communication Plans:** State Farm detailed plans to develop policyholder notices when implementing coverage changes for renewal customers, ensuring compliance with DOI requirements.

**6. ** **Supporting Documents and Schedules**
- **Endorsement Details:** Full text of Form HO-2789 outlining the Roof Surfaces Payment Schedule and conditions.
- **Premium Adjustment Schedules:** Comprehensive tables showing premium reductions based on roof age and material type.
- **Rate/Rule Schedules:** Updated Kansas RSPS Manual Page linked to the filing.
- **Forms List:** Detailed listing of all related forms and endorsements approved under the HO-47509 product.
- **Response to Objections:** Multiple response letters addressing DOI’s specific concerns and providing necessary clarifications and documentation.

**7. ** **Impact on Policyholders**
- **New Business:** Mandatory endorsement application for approximately 2000 new policies annually in high-risk areas.
- **Renewal Business:** Optional for existing policyholders living outside designated high-risk zip codes; mandatory once specific criteria are met based on roof age and type.
- **Policyholder Communication:** Future notices will inform policyholders of coverage reductions, ensuring transparency and compliance with regulatory mandates.

**8. ** **Conclusion**
State Farm has successfully navigated regulatory objections by providing detailed responses and necessary documentation, leading to the approval and filing of the updated HO-47509 homeowners insurance product in Kansas. The changes aim to better manage risk exposure related to severe weather events by adjusting coverage and premiums based on roof characteristics and geographical risk factors.

This summary provides an overview of the key aspects of State Farm’s rate filing for Kansas homeowners insurance, highlighting changes to coverage, premium adjustments, regulatory interactions, and the overall impact on policyholders.","The filing submitted by State Farm Fire and Casualty Company pertains to a change in the use of their previously approved ""ROOF SURFACES PAYMENT SCHEDULE ENDORSEMENT"" (Form HO-2789) for homeowners insurance in Kansas. The key points of the filing are as follows:

### Filing Overview:
- **Filing Type**: Form/Rule
- **Date Submitted**: September 6, 2024
- **Status**: Closed-Approved and Filed
- **Effective Date (New)**: April 15, 2025
- **State**: Kansas
- **Company**: State Farm Fire and Casualty Company
- **Product Name**: HO-47509

### Purpose of the Filing:
- The filing seeks to modify the usage of the HO-2789 endorsement from being optional to mandatory for specific policyholders. This change targets new business customers with particular roof types located in high-risk areas for wind and hail damage.

### Key Details of the Endorsement:
- **Endorsement Details**: HO-2789 modifies the loss settlement provisions for roof surfaces damaged by windstorm or hail. The endorsement limits the payment to a percentage of the roof's replacement or repair costs based on the age and type of the roof material.
- **New Usage Rule**: The endorsement will be mandatory for policyholders with architectural shingles that are 10 years or older and who are located in designated high-risk areas for severe convective storms (hail and wind).

### High-Risk Areas:
- The filing specifies the counties in Kansas affected by this new rule. These include Barton, Butler, Chase, and others, with partial coverage in counties like Coffey, Jackson, and Shawnee. Additionally, specific zip codes within these counties are listed where the rule will apply.

### Premium Adjustments:
- The filing includes a ""BASIC PREMIUM ADJUSTMENTS"" section that outlines the premium reduction policyholders will receive based on the age and type of their roof. The adjustments range from no reduction for roofs replaced during the current calendar year to up to a 33% reduction for roofs over 30 years old.

### Objections and Responses:
- The filing encountered multiple objections from the Kansas Department of Insurance (KDOI) regarding the need for clearer communication of the changes to policyholders, the necessity for updated forms usage rules, and the demonstration of rate actions without the proposed benefit reduction.
- State Farm responded to these objections by clarifying the application of the endorsement, providing detailed lists of affected zip codes, and confirming that the changes would only apply to new business initially. They also addressed the need for future notifications to renewal customers, stating that they would develop notices in compliance with applicable laws.

### Final Approval:
- The filing was eventually approved and filed on February 13, 2025, with the new usage rule for HO-2789 set to take effect on April 15, 2025, for new business.

This filing represents a strategic adjustment by State Farm to manage exposure to severe convective storms in high-risk areas of Kansas while maintaining coverage options for policyholders."

**3. Rationale and Methodology**

- **Loss Trends:**
  - **Adjusted Frequency and Severity Trends:** Rate Counsel reviewed and adjusted the loss trends based on historical data and industry benchmarks to ensure realistic projections.

  - **Return on Equity:** Initially proposed at 15.0%, deemed excessive by Rate Counsel, which cited industry averages (~6.5%-10%).

- **Expense Provisions:**
  - **Fixed Expenses:** Comprising acquisition, general expenses, and installment fees.

Additionally, the filing includes cleanup of the rate table to remove non-current deductible options and eliminates a discount previously available when Equipment Breakdown coverage was also attached to the policy.

4. **Rate Indications:**
   - The rate indications provided in Exhibit 1 were calculated using the loss ratio method, covering accident quarters through 6/30/24, evaluated at 9/30/24. The filing includes adjustments for on-leveling, premium trend, loss trend, loss development, credibility, catastrophe provision, excess loss provision, and expense ratios.

Overall, the filing represents a comprehensive update to Lemonade's homeowners insurance pricing in Oregon, aimed at ensuring that premiums accurately reflect current risks and costs. The proposed rate changes are supported by detailed actuarial analysis and align with industry standards."

- **Rate Change:** Proposed increase of **19.0%**

**Purpose of the Filing:**
Allstate Indemnity Company is proposing a significant rate increase for its Condominium Homeowners insurance product in South Carolina. The primary objective is to adjust the Rate Adjustment Factor (RAF) and Coverage A amounts to align premiums with the company’s projected loss experience and expense provisions.

**Key Components of the Filing:**

1. **Rate Adjustment Factor (RAF):**
   - **Current RAF:** 2.342
   - **Proposed RAF:** 2.842
   - **Impact:** The RAF adjustment facilitates a uniform premium increase without altering individual territorial base rates significantly.

2. **Coverage Adjustments:**
   - **Coverage A (Building Property Protection) Increased Limits:**

     - **Proposed Buy-Up Premium for $100 Deductible:** $4.66
     - **Percentage Change:** 28.4%
     - Similar adjustments are made for other deductible levels, maintaining relativity between different deductible options.

3. **Actuarial Basis and Methodology:**
   - **Loss Modeling:** Utilizes AIR Worldwide’s Touchstone hurricane model (version 18.1.3) to simulate potential hurricane losses.
   - **Loss Development Factors:** Applied using the Link Ratio method to estimate ultimate losses.
   - **Trend Analysis:** Separate analysis for non-weather and weather-related losses, incorporating credibility procedures and actuarial judgment.
   - **Expense Provisions:** Detailed provisions for fixed and variable expenses, including commissions, taxes, acquisition expenses, and underwriting profit.

4. **Reinsurance Strategy:**
   - **Net Cost of Reinsurance (NCOR):** Represents the incremental cost of reinsurance contracts, calculated as expected premiums minus expected recoveries.
   - **Reinsurance Contracts:** A mix of traditional reinsurance and Insurance-Linked Securities (ILS) contracts placed to manage catastrophe exposure, particularly for hurricanes.

5. **Objections and Responses:**
   - **Department of Insurance Objections:** Addressed concerns regarding overlap in loss adjustment fees, sufficiency of catastrophe loss data, and justification for rate increases despite favorable underwriting results.
   - **Resolution:** Comprehensive responses and supporting documentation were provided, leading to the approval of the filing on January 29, 2025.

6. **Financial Impact:**
   - **Written Premium Change:** An increase of approximately $4,050,873.
   - **Number of Policyholders Affected:** 7,884.
   - **Maximum and Minimum Rate Changes:** Up to 24.5% increase with a minimum change of 7.8%.

**Competitive Implications:**
- **Market Positioning:** A 19% rate increase positions Allstate Indemnity Company to better manage increased risk and expense projections, particularly from hurricane-related losses.
- **Policyholder Impact:** Significant premium hikes may affect policyholder retention and acquisition, especially in regions with high exposure to natural catastrophes.
- **Reinsurance Dependence:** The robust reinsurance strategy underscores Allstate's commitment to mitigating large-scale loss events, potentially offering more stable long-term pricing despite short-term rate increases.

**Conclusion:**
Allstate Indemnity Company’s rate filing for the AI CON product in South Carolina reflects a strategic adjustment to address rising loss costs and ensure financial stability amid heightened exposure to catastrophic events. The comprehensive actuarial analysis, coupled with a strong reinsurance program, supports the proposed 19% rate increase. While this adjustment may enhance the company’s risk management and profitability, it also poses challenges in maintaining competitiveness and policyholder satisfaction in the regional market.

**Additional Notes:**
- **Compliance:** The filing adheres to relevant Actuarial Standards of Practice and South Carolina Department of Insurance regulations.
- **Documentation:** Extensive attachments and exhibits provide detailed methodological support, including actuarial memoranda, loss development factors, expense provisions, and reinsurance summaries.

**Strategic Considerations for Competitors:**
Insurers operating in the same market segment should monitor Allstate’s adjustments closely, as a substantial rate increase may create opportunities for competitors to attract policyholders through more competitive pricing. Additionally, understanding Allstate’s reinsurance and catastrophe modeling approaches can inform risk management and pricing strategies within the industry.","The rate filing submitted by Allstate Indemnity Company to the South Carolina Department of Insurance proposes a 19.0% overall rate level increase for their Condominium Homeowners product, named AI CON. The filing was submitted on August 16, 2024, and was approved on January 29, 2025, with the new and renewal effective dates being October 28, 2024, and December 12, 2024, respectively.

**Key Points of the Filing:**

1. **Rate Increase Justification:**
   - The proposed rate change is based on a comprehensive analysis of historical and projected loss experiences, adjusted for various factors such as loss development, loss trends, and expenses.
   - The filing uses the AIR Worldwide Touchstone 2022 US Hurricane Model Version 18.1.3 to account for hurricane losses, which were removed from historical data and replaced with a modeled provision.

2. **Rate Adjustment Factor (RAF):**
   - The RAF is being updated from 2.342 to 2.842 to achieve the targeted 19.0% increase. The RAF is used as an offset factor to uniformly revise policyholder premiums without changing individual territorial base rates.

3. **Coverage A Increased Limits Premium:**
   - The premium for increased limits on Coverage A (Building Property Protection) is being modified. The buy-up premium for a $100 deductible is proposed to change from $3.63 to $4.57 per $1,000 of increased limit, resulting in a 25.9% increase. For a $250 deductible, the buy-up premium is proposed to increase from $3.25 to $4.09, resulting in a 25.8% increase.

4. **Rate Changes by Premium Type:**
   - Variable Package Premium: 21.3% increase
   - Fixed Expense Premium: No change
   - Additional Coverages - Coverage A: 25.9% increase
   - Additional Coverages - Excluding Coverage A: No change
   - Net Cost of Reinsurance (NCOR): No change

5. **Supporting Documentation:**
   - The filing includes various exhibits and attachments that detail the methodology and data used in the rate level indication, including loss development factors, loss trends, expense provisions, and reinsurance costs.
   - Actuarial standards of practice were followed, and the filing was prepared by Alexander Robinson, FCAS, who confirmed compliance with relevant actuarial standards.

6. **Reinsurance Considerations:**
   - The filing accounts for the net cost of reinsurance, which is calculated based on the expected reinsurance premium and expected recoveries. This is allocated to the state and line of business level using modeled losses.

7. **Objections and Responses:**
   - The filing faced several objections from the Department of Insurance, primarily concerning the justification of the rate increase, the overlap of loss adjustment expenses, and the need for historical and prospective loss trend data. Allstate responded to these objections with detailed explanations and supporting documentation.

The filing aims to ensure that the rates reflect the expected costs accurately and fairly distribute the rate change across different components of the premium. The increase is intended to cover rising loss costs and maintain adequate underwriting results in the face of changing risk environments."

In compliance with 28 TAC 5.9342, we are submitting enhanced underwriting guidelines effective January 1, 2025 for
manufactured home property insurance in Texas.  These underwriting guidelines will be distributed to our underwriters and
agents in Texas via our company intranet and include the following changes.
The marked-up copy, for comparison purposes, displays: underwriting philosophy and guidance that was removed with
strikethrough and added with highlighting.
•Updated Coastal Consistency section with IBHS Fortified for Safer Living designation criteria.
We apologize for the delay in filing these Underwriting Guideline updates which were already distributed to underwriters and
agents in Texas. We realized this was inadvertantly not submitted within the appropriate timeframe. These guideline changes
were not restrictive in nature, they were broadening the potential eligibility for dwellings in specific coastal areas.
These underwriting guidelines are confidential proprietary trade secret information of State Farm and are labeled as such.
These underwriting guidelines are trade secrets under Texas law, excepted from disclosure pursuant to §§ 552.110(a) and
552.101 of the Texas Public Information Act.  In addition, the underwriting guidelines are commercial or financial information
that, if disclosed, would cause substantial competitive harm to the respective State Farm Insurance Companies filing them,
which are excepted from required disclosure pursuant to § 552.110(b) of that Act.
State Farm considers these underwriting guidelines to be confidential and proprietary trade secret information and can
demonstrate that they are confidential by law under judicial decisions of the Texas courts, including Hyde Corp. v. Huffines,
314 S.W.2d 763  (Tex.), cert. denied, 358 U.S. 898 (1958) and Computer Associates International, Inc. v. Altai, Inc., 918
S.W.2d 453 (Tex. 1994).  That is, State Farm’s underwriting guidelines are a “compilation of information used in [State Farm’s]
business” that give State Farm “an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competititors who do not know or use it,” which is
the “generally accepted definition of a ‘trade secret’” contained in the Restatement of Torts, § 757 (1939) that has been
adopted by the Texas Supreme Court.  314 S.W.2d at 776; 918 S.W.2d at 455.
All of the factors that the Restatement of Torts identifies as relevant in determining whether given information constitutes a
trade secret, under this definition, indicate that State Farm’s underwriting guidelines are trade secrets under the governing law.
These guidelines have been developed at great effort and expense to State Farm, are of great competitive value to State
Farm, are not known generally outside State Farm, cannot be duplicated, and are subject to reasonable efforts to maintain
their confidentiality.  State Farm’s underwriting guidelines are not disclosed outside of State Farm, except pursuant to
confidentiality agreements or filings made with regulators in which State Farm has claimed confidentiality.  The underwriting
guidelines are treated as confidential under limited distribution within State Farm to those with a need to know or access the
information.  State Farm takes measures to safeguard its underwriting guidelines.  State Farm labels the underwriting
guidelines as trade secret and has an enterprise policy on trade secrets and confidential information applicable to all of its
employees and agents that specifies underwriting guidelines, policies and procedures as examples of trade secrets within
State Farm.  Underwriting guidelines are clearly valuable to State Farm and to State Farm’s competitors.  Without access
through public disclosure by the Department, State Farm’s competitors could not duplicate or acquire State Farm’s
underwriting guidelines.  Finally, State Farm’s underwriting guidelines have been developed over many years and State Farm
has expended significant amounts of effort, money and personnel in developing the eligibility criteria and underwriting
judgments built into the underwriting guidelines.
Our submission of this information is not intended, and should not be construed, as any waiver by State Farm of either the
confidentiality or trade secret status of the underwriting guidelines and eligibility criteria. State Farm is filing this information on
the understanding that it will not be disseminated either within the Department of Insurance beyond those with a need for
access or to anyone outside the Department.

Any public release of this information would make it available to State Farm’s competitors and would provide them with
extremely valuable information they could not otherwise obtain concerning State Farm’s underwriting and eligibility criteria.
The enclosed underwriting guidelines are the eligibility criteria for State Farm Lloyds in the state of Texas and define State
Farm’s target market and customer base.  Obviously, such information is critical to State Farm’s continuing operation and
would be immensely valuable to State Farm’s competitors.  Providing State Farm’s competitors with this type of information, at
no cost, for them to use to State Farm’s competitive disadvantage is grossly unfair and anticompetitive.  Public release of this
information would defeat State Farm’s consistent efforts to keep this information confidential and out of State Farm’s
competitors hands and would destroy its trade secret value, not only in Texas, but in other states where the same guidelines
are in use, and therefore would constitute an unconstitutional taking of our trade secret property rights without just
compensation under both state and federal law.
State Farm also believes that underwriting guidelines and eligibility criteria should not be made public as a matter of public
policy, because disclosure could disrupt the healthy functioning of market competition in the insurance market.  If State Farm’s
underwriting guidelines and eligibility criteria were made public, competitors could use those underwriting materials instead of
their own in an effort to duplicate State Farm’s success in the residential property insurance market.  The result would be more
homogeneity in the type of risks written in that market, less responsiveness to diverse market demands, and diminished
availability and variety in products and services.  Companies need incentives to spend the time, effort and money necessary to
develop new and innovative products which provide them with competitive advantages over their competitors.  Freely
disclosing a company’s underwriting guidelines to its competitors removes important incentives for a company to expend the
money and effort necessary to differentiate itself and diversify by means of its underwriting guidelines and eligibility criteria.
The public interest is not served by disclosing an insurer’s valuable proprietary trade secret information to its competitors and
risking a disruption in the residential property insurance market.
State Farm requests that the Department keep the enclosed materials separate from files which are open to public access or
inspection.  Should any request be made to review any of our underwriting guidelines on file with the Department, we
respectfully request prior notice and an opportunity to demonstrate, in the appropriate administrative or judicial forum, that this
information is a trade secret, confidential by law, that may not be made public by the Department.
We appreciate your attention to our claim of confidentiality over State Farm’s underwriting guidelines and we appreciate your
cooperation in keeping them confidential.

State Farm requests that the Department keep the enclosed materials separate from files which are open to public access or
inspection.  Should any request be made to review any of our underwriting guidelines on file with the Department, we
respectfully request prior notice and an opportunity to demonstrate, in the appropriate administrative or judicial forum, that this
information is a trade secret, confidential by law, that may not be made public by the Department.
We appreciate your attention to our claim of confidentiality over State Farm’s underwriting guidelines and we appreciate your
cooperation in keeping them confidential.
