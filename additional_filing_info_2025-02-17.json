        "xai_summary": "The provided document is a filing with the Arizona Department of Insurance (DOI) from Farmers Insurance Company of Arizona, specifically related to their \"Flex Home\" product. The filing focuses on form changes rather than rate changes, as indicated by the absence of rate data in the filing. Here is a summary of the key aspects of this filing:\n\n### Filing Overview\n\n- **Filing Company:** Farmers Insurance Company of Arizona\n- **Product Name:** Flex Home\n- **State:** Arizona\n- **Type of Insurance (TOI):** Homeowners\n- **Sub-Type of Insurance (Sub-TOI):** Homeowners Sub-TOI Combinations\n- **Filing Type:** Form\n- **Date Submitted:** October 2, 2024\n- **SERFF Tracking Number:** FARM-134267371\n- **Status:** Closed-Form Approved\n- **Effective Date (New):** March 17, 2025\n- **Effective Date (Renewal):** April 19, 2025\n\n### Purpose of the Filing\n\nThe filing is for the submission of new Personal Lines Homeowners endorsements for the Farmers FlexSM Personal Home Policy. The filing includes updates to the Home Sharing Coverage Endorsement to its second edition.\n\n### Key Endorsements and Forms\n\n1. **Coverage C (Personal Property) Broad Named Perils Coverage (G7726 - 1st Edition)**\n   - Form Number: 93-7726\n   - This form was initially part of the filing but was later withdrawn and replaced.\n\n2. **Home Sharing Coverage Endorsement (G7634 - 2nd Edition)**\n   - Form Number: 93-7634\n   - This endorsement provides coverage for property located on the residence premises used for a home share business, subject to the terms and conditions of the policy.\n\n3. **Coverage C (Personal Property) Broad Named Perils Coverage-Arizona (AZ057 - 1st Edition)**\n   - Form Number: 94-3926\n   - This form is specific to Arizona and provides similar coverage as the G7726 form but tailored for the state.\n\n### Objections and Responses\n\nThe filing faced several objections from the Arizona DOI, primarily concerning the inclusion of Equipment Breakdown Coverage in the policy forms. The objections raised are summarized below:\n\n- **Objection 1 (November 1, 2024):** The Department objected to including service contract coverages in an insurance policy, specifically the Equipment Breakdown Coverage. The company responded by arguing that this coverage is not a service contract and should remain in the policy.\n- **Objection 2 (November 15, 2024):** The Department requested the removal of the Equipment Breakdown Coverage language and a revision or withdrawal of related rate or rule filings within 60 days. The company acknowledged the concern but requested to maintain the countrywide endorsement for consistency and cost efficiency.\n- **Objection 3 (January 15, 2025):** The Department noted that despite the company's valid response, an equipment breakdown endorsement still existed and needed to be filed as a withdrawn form in Arizona. The company responded by submitting an updated endorsement without reference to equipment breakdown coverage and planned to address the existing coverage in a separate filing.\n\n### Final Disposition\n\n- **Disposition Date:** February 14, 2025\n- **Status:** Form Approved\n- **Comment:** The Arizona Department of Insurance approved the form, noting that subsequent findings of non-compliance with ARS Title 20 could lead to re-engagement with the filer or withdrawal of approval.\n\n### Additional Information\n\n- **Filing Contact:** Russell Jennings, Product Manager at Farmers Insurance\n- **Supporting Documents:** Included are various checklists, instructions, and redlines related to the filing.\n- **Fees:** No state fees were required for this filing.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis filing by Farmers Insurance Company of Arizona focused on updating the forms for their Flex Home product, specifically addressing the Home Sharing Coverage Endorsement and the Coverage C (Personal Property) Broad Named Perils Coverage. The filing process involved several objections from the Arizona DOI related to the Equipment Breakdown Coverage, which were addressed by the company. Ultimately, the forms were approved with the condition that any future non-compliance could lead to further action by the Department."

The filing, assigned company tracking number ER52305, pertains to the product line \"EIC Home, Condo, Renters, Dwelling Fire\" under the Homeowners segment. The requested effective date for the changes is May 1, 2025. As of the latest update on February 12, 2025, the filing status is \"Pending State Action\" with the state status on \"Hold.\"\n\n**Key Changes Proposed:**\n1. **Underwriting Guidelines Revisions:**\n   - **Wildfire Risk Score Adjustment:** The renewal eligibility for policies is proposed to change the Wildfire Risk Score threshold from less than 50 to less than 20. This adjustment aims to mitigate wildfire-related risks more effectively.\n   - **Maximum Binding Authority:** An increase in the maximum binding authority for Dwelling Primary Protection Classes 1-8 from $1,500,000 to $1,750,000.\n   - **Family and Dwelling Limits:** Introduction of caps on the number of families and dwellings that can be insured under owner-occupied and rental properties, specifically limiting to a maximum of four families and four tenant-occupied dwellings.\n   - **Ineligible Exposures Expansion:** Broadened definitions excluding dwellings in Marin, San Francisco, and San Mateo counties, structures on slopes exceeding 20 degrees, and various construction types such as steel construction, yurt homes, and properties with knob and tube wiring.\n\n2. **Fee Adjustments:**\n   - **Billing Fees:** Introduction of new fees including a $5 Direct Bill fee, a $5 Credit Card fee, and a $25 Non-Sufficient Funds (NSF) fee to cover administrative costs related to payments and returned checks.\n\n3. **Impact on Policyholders:**\n   - Approximately 7.5% of Encompass’s California home book may be affected by the proposed changes, primarily through increased non-renewals for properties with higher wildfire risk scores.\n\n**Regulatory Interaction:**\nThe DOI raised multiple objections to Encompass's filing, primarily seeking clarifications on:\n- The number of policyholders impacted by each change.\n- The rationale and consequences (e.g., premium adjustments) of the proposed underwriting modifications.\n- Specific queries regarding the addition of loss history details and reasons behind certain ineligibility criteria.\n\nEncompass responded by:\n- Confirming the total premium amount for its book of business as $41,281,363.\n- Pausing all non-renewals for the 885 policies initially planned for non-renewal due to wildfire moratoriums imposed by the Commissioner.\n- Clarifying that no rate adjustments are expected from the underwriting changes, asserting rate neutrality.\n- Providing detailed explanations for each objection, including the methodology behind determining sufficient rates and the decision to adjust wildfire risk scores without changing the wildfire score vendor.\n\n**Conclusion and Next Steps:**\nEncompass Insurance Company is actively addressing the DOI's objections by providing comprehensive responses and adjusting its proposed changes in response to regulatory feedback. The company emphasizes its commitment to managing wildfire risks without impacting overall premium structures adversely. The filing remains under DOI review, awaiting final approval or further regulatory action.\n\n**Competitive Insights:**\nEncompass’s proactive adjustments in underwriting guidelines reflect a strategic move to enhance risk management, particularly concerning wildfire exposures in California. By increasing binding authorities and tightening eligibility criteria, Encompass aims to sustain its market position while mitigating potential losses from high-risk properties. The introduction of administrative fees aligns with industry trends to offset operational costs. These changes may set a precedent for competitive practices among insurers operating in wildfire-prone regions.",

The filing requests approval for revised rates effective February 15, 2025, for new business and April 15, 2025, for renewals. Notably, the overall rate level change is neutral at 0.0%, indicating no adjustment to premium rates across the board.\n\n**Key Changes and Enhancements:**\n1. **Introduction of By-Peril Rating:** The filing introduces a by-peril rating approach for Homeowners policies, allowing premiums to be calculated separately for each covered peril (e.g., fire, wind/hail, crime). This method aims to enhance accuracy and fairness in premium determination based on specific risk exposures.\n   \n2. **Location Rating Factors (LRF) and Construction Classifications:** Adjustments have been made to the LRF and construction classifications to better reflect the risk associated with different geographic zones and building types. Updated factors are accessible via State Farm’s internal rate grid.\n\n3. **Fixed Expense Constant:** A new fixed expense constant of $143 is introduced for each Homeowners policy, intended to cover administrative and operational costs.\n\n4. **Optional Coverages and Discounts:** \n   - **Home Alert Protection:** Discounts for fire and burglary prevention measures, such as alarm systems, have been revised.\n   - **Home/AUTO Discount:** Enhanced discounts for policyholders who also hold a private passenger automobile policy with State Farm.\n   - **Loyal Customer Discount:** Adjusted premiums based on the number of consecutive months insured with State Farm.\n   - **Wind Mitigation and Energy Efficiency:** Updated discounts for properties with fortified structures and energy-efficient upgrades.\n\n5. **Deductibles and Loss Settlement Provisions:** The filing details various deductible options and loss settlement provisions, including specific adjustments for hurricane deductibles based on dwelling location and construction standards.\n\n**Correspondence and Objections:**\nThroughout the filing process, the Connecticut Insurance Department raised several objections, primarily concerning:\n- **Wind/Hail Exclusion References:** Recommendations to remove misleading references implying the availability of wind/hail exclusions.\n- **Modeling and Actuarial Practices:** Requests for detailed explanations of the modeling techniques, weight of evidence (WoE) coding, and adherence to actuarial standards to ensure fairness and avoidance of unintentional bias.\n- **Effective Date Revisions:** Adjustments to the effective dates of the rate changes were requested and subsequently approved.\n\nState Farm addressed these objections through detailed response letters, committing to revise manuals, provide additional documentation, and ensure compliance with all regulatory requirements. Additionally, State Farm requested confidentiality for certain proprietary documents, which the Department is in the process of reviewing.\n\n**Impact and Implementation:**\n- **Written Premiums:** The filing projects a written premium of approximately $180.39 million, with a slight negative impact of $304 attributed to the rate adjustments.\n- **Policyholders Affected:** Around 145,762 policyholders will be impacted by these changes.\n- **Implementation Timeline:** To facilitate the smooth transition to the new rates, State Farm plans to commence implementation procedures by October 11, 2024.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis Rate and Rule filing signifies State Farm’s efforts to refine their Homeowners insurance offerings in Connecticut through enhanced rating methodologies, improved operational efficiencies, and a focus on both competitive pricing and robust risk management. With a neutral rate change, the primary benefits lie in the structural and procedural advancements aimed at better aligning premiums with actual risk profiles and fostering long-term financial stability.",

(ASIC), part of the Progressive Group.\n- **Product:** Homeowners Insurance (HOH).\n- **State of Filing:** Idaho.\n- **Filing Type:** Rate/Rule Revision.\n- **Date Submitted:** December 23, 2024.\n- **Effective Dates:**\n  - **New Policies:** Requested to be effective May 21, 2025.\n  - **Renewals:** Requested to be effective July 21, 2025.\n- **Filing Status:** Pending State Action as of January 13, 2025.\n- **SERFF Tracking Number:** AMSI-134173339.\n\n**Key Changes and Highlights:**\n1. **Transition to a 12-Peril Rating Model:**\n   - ASIC is moving from a simplified 3-peril model to a more detailed 12-peril model.\n   - This shift introduces material structural changes to peril-level ratings, affecting premium calculations on a granular, table-by-table basis.\n   - The comprehensive model aims to provide more accurate and individualized premium assessments based on a broader range of risk factors.\n\n2. **Rate Increases:**\n   - **Overall Rate Change:** The filing proposes an overall rate increase of **37.6%** for the Idaho HOH program.\n   - **Historical Rate Changes for Comparison:**\n     - July 31, 2024: **+30.09%**\n     - November 1, 2023: **+14.91%** (based on the current GLM model)\n     - December 14, 2022: **0.0%**\n     - May 20, 2021: **-3.6%**\n   - **Impact Metrics:**\n     - **Number of Policyholders Affected:** 5,095\n     - **Written Premium for Program:** $7,721,222\n\n3. **Rate Change Distribution:**\n   - **Maximum Rate Increase:** Up to **760.15%** in specific cases (likely outliers or specific high-risk scenarios).\n   - **Minimum Rate Change:** As low as **-46.20%**, indicating possible rate reductions for certain low-risk policyholders.\n\n4. **Rate Schedules and Factors:**\n   - **Territory Factors:** Rates vary significantly by zip code, reflecting localized risk assessments. Each zip code has distinct factors for various perils like tornado, wind, hail, fire, theft, etc.\n   - **Dwelling Coverage Adjustments:** Rates increase with higher coverage amounts, starting from $50,000 up to $10,000,000. Each coverage tier has specific rate factors for different perils.\n   - **Construction Type and Protection Class:**\n     - Differentiated rates based on the type of construction (e.g., Frame, Masonry, Superior) and protection class (ranging from Class 1 to Class 10).\n     - Higher protection classes generally correspond to higher rates due to increased risk mitigation features.\n   - **Exterior Wall and Roofing Materials:**\n     - Rates are adjusted based on the materials used for exterior walls and roofing. For instance, masonry constructions and superior roofing materials like slate and architectural shingles have different rate factors compared to wood or metal counterparts.\n     - The age of the roof also influences rates, with older roofs typically incurring higher premiums due to increased risk of damage.\n\n5. **Response to State Objections:**\n   - ASIC addressed concerns regarding policyholders experiencing more than a 15% rate increase by providing detailed factor support documents.\n   - Emphasis on the reasonableness and accuracy of the new 12-peril model in reflecting individual policyholder risks.\n\n6. **Attachments and Supporting Documentation:**\n   - **Rate Manuals:** Comprehensive manuals detailing base rates, territory factors, construction types, exterior wall types, roofing materials, and dwelling coverage amounts.\n   - **Exhibits:** Includes Factor Support documents and actuarial memoranda explaining the transition to the 12-peril model.\n   - **Response Letters:** Detailed responses to state objections, reinforcing the validity and necessity of the proposed rate changes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAmerican Strategic Insurance Corp. is implementing a significant rate increase of approximately 37.6% for its Idaho Homeowners Insurance program, driven by a transition to a more detailed 12-peril rating model. This model enhances the precision of premium calculations by accounting for a wider array of risk factors, including localized risks, construction types, and material specifics. While the overall rate increase aligns with previous adjustments, the introduction of granular factors ensures that premiums more accurately reflect individual policyholder risks. ASIC has proactively addressed state concerns by providing comprehensive supporting documentation to validate the proposed changes.\n\n**Recommendations for Competitive Intelligence:**\n- **Monitor Competitor Rate Changes:** Assess how other insurance providers in Idaho are adjusting their rates, especially those utilizing multi-peril models.\n- **Analyze Market Impact:** Evaluate the potential market share shifts due to significant rate increases and the adoption of more complex rating models.\n- **Customer Communication Strategies:** Observe ASIC’s approach to communicating these changes to policyholders to anticipate customer retention challenges and opportunities for differentiation.\n- **Regulatory Compliance:** Stay updated on Idaho state insurance regulations to understand the approval process and any barriers competitors might face in similar rate adjustments.\n\n**Contact Information:**\n- **Filing Contact:** Laert Fejzullari, Assistant Product Manager\n- **Email:** laert_fejzullari@progressive.com\n- **Phone:** 440-395-1634\n- **Address:** 1 ASI Way N, St. Petersburg, FL 33702\n\nIf further detailed analysis or specific sections of the rate manual are required, please let me know.",

For example, a roof replaced six years prior with metal composition would receive a 5% premium reduction.\n  - **Mandatory Areas:** Premium adjustments are designed to reflect the increased risk in high-hail and windstorm areas.\n\n**4. ** **Geographical Impact**\n- **Affected Zip Codes:** Approximately 2000 new business customers annually in designated high-risk areas across numerous Kansas counties.\n- **High-Risk Areas Include:** Counties such as Barton, Butler, Chase, and others, with partial impact on certain zip codes within these counties.\n\n**5. ** **Regulatory Interaction and Objections**\n- **Objections from Kansas Department of Insurance (DOI):**\n  - **Form Usage Clarifications:** DOI required State Farm to update the forms usage rule to specify roof types and high-risk locations where the endorsement becomes mandatory.\n  - **Supporting Documentation:** Requests for detailed lists of impacted zip codes, redlined documents showing changes to previously approved forms/rates, and explanations on policyholder communications.\n  - **Policyholder Notices:** Instructions to provide a clear, 1-page summary explaining coverage reductions to affected policyholders, to be distributed via mail and email at least 30 days before policy renewal.\n  \n- **State Farm’s Responses:**\n  - **Clarifications Provided:** State Farm confirmed no changes to the wording of existing endorsements or rates but clarified the shift from optional to mandatory usage in high-risk areas.\n  - **Documentation Supplied:** Submitted lists of impacted zip codes (KS_RSPS_Zips.xlsx & KS_RSPS_Zips.pdf), relocated the Rate Manual Page to the appropriate schedule tab, and engaged in multiple conference calls with DOI representatives.\n  - **Policy Communication Plans:** State Farm detailed plans to develop policyholder notices when implementing coverage changes for renewal customers, ensuring compliance with DOI requirements.\n\n**6. ** **Supporting Documents and Schedules**\n- **Endorsement Details:** Full text of Form HO-2789 outlining the Roof Surfaces Payment Schedule and conditions.\n- **Premium Adjustment Schedules:** Comprehensive tables showing premium reductions based on roof age and material type.\n- **Rate/Rule Schedules:** Updated Kansas RSPS Manual Page linked to the filing.\n- **Forms List:** Detailed listing of all related forms and endorsements approved under the HO-47509 product.\n- **Response to Objections:** Multiple response letters addressing DOI’s specific concerns and providing necessary clarifications and documentation.\n\n**7. ** **Impact on Policyholders**\n- **New Business:** Mandatory endorsement application for approximately 2000 new policies annually in high-risk areas.\n- **Renewal Business:** Optional for existing policyholders living outside designated high-risk zip codes; mandatory once specific criteria are met based on roof age and type.\n- **Policyholder Communication:** Future notices will inform policyholders of coverage reductions, ensuring transparency and compliance with regulatory mandates.\n\n**8. ** **Conclusion**\nState Farm has successfully navigated regulatory objections by providing detailed responses and necessary documentation, leading to the approval and filing of the updated HO-47509 homeowners insurance product in Kansas. The changes aim to better manage risk exposure related to severe weather events by adjusting coverage and premiums based on roof characteristics and geographical risk factors.\n\n**Contact Information:**\n- **Filing Contact:** John Poppe, CPCU, CLU\n- **Email:** john.poppe.pkxx@statefarm.com\n- **Phone:** 309-994-9734\n\n**Effective Implementation Date:** April 15, 2025\n\n---\n\nThis summary provides an overview of the key aspects of State Farm’s rate filing for Kansas homeowners insurance, highlighting changes to coverage, premium adjustments, regulatory interactions, and the overall impact on policyholders.",
        "xai_summary": "The filing submitted by State Farm Fire and Casualty Company pertains to a change in the use of their previously approved \"ROOF SURFACES PAYMENT SCHEDULE ENDORSEMENT\" (Form HO-2789) for homeowners insurance in Kansas. The key points of the filing are as follows:\n\n### Filing Overview:\n- **Filing Type**: Form/Rule\n- **Date Submitted**: September 6, 2024\n- **Status**: Closed-Approved and Filed\n- **Effective Date (New)**: April 15, 2025\n- **State**: Kansas\n- **Company**: State Farm Fire and Casualty Company\n- **Product Name**: HO-47509\n\n### Purpose of the Filing:\n- The filing seeks to modify the usage of the HO-2789 endorsement from being optional to mandatory for specific policyholders. This change targets new business customers with particular roof types located in high-risk areas for wind and hail damage.\n\n### Key Details of the Endorsement:\n- **Endorsement Details**: HO-2789 modifies the loss settlement provisions for roof surfaces damaged by windstorm or hail. The endorsement limits the payment to a percentage of the roof's replacement or repair costs based on the age and type of the roof material.\n- **New Usage Rule**: The endorsement will be mandatory for policyholders with architectural shingles that are 10 years or older and who are located in designated high-risk areas for severe convective storms (hail and wind).\n\n### High-Risk Areas:\n- The filing specifies the counties in Kansas affected by this new rule. These include Barton, Butler, Chase, and others, with partial coverage in counties like Coffey, Jackson, and Shawnee. Additionally, specific zip codes within these counties are listed where the rule will apply.\n\n### Premium Adjustments:\n- The filing includes a \"BASIC PREMIUM ADJUSTMENTS\" section that outlines the premium reduction policyholders will receive based on the age and type of their roof. The adjustments range from no reduction for roofs replaced during the current calendar year to up to a 33% reduction for roofs over 30 years old.\n\n### Objections and Responses:\n- The filing encountered multiple objections from the Kansas Department of Insurance (KDOI) regarding the need for clearer communication of the changes to policyholders, the necessity for updated forms usage rules, and the demonstration of rate actions without the proposed benefit reduction.\n- State Farm responded to these objections by clarifying the application of the endorsement, providing detailed lists of affected zip codes, and confirming that the changes would only apply to new business initially. They also addressed the need for future notifications to renewal customers, stating that they would develop notices in compliance with applicable laws.\n\n### Final Approval:\n- The filing was eventually approved and filed on February 13, 2025, with the new usage rule for HO-2789 set to take effect on April 15, 2025, for new business.\n\nThis filing represents a strategic adjustment by State Farm to manage exposure to severe convective storms in high-risk areas of Kansas while maintaining coverage options for policyholders."

The Company provided lift charts for GLMs across different perils (Hail, Wind, Water Backup, and Weather Water), demonstrating strong model performance on training, validation, and out-of-time datasets. The variable selection process involved reviewing AIC changes when variables were removed from the model, confirming their statistical significance.\n\n### Correspondence and Objections\nThe filing process included several objection letters and responses. Key objections raised by the Kentucky Department of Insurance and reviewed by Taylor & Mulder, Inc., involved clarifications on the Nearmap model, proposed factors, and validation metrics.

CAT Modeling and Data Sources:**\n- **Model Utilized:** AIR Hurricane Model for the United States v1.0 in Touchstone Version 9.0 (Released July 2021).\n- **Data Inputs:** Company-based data including property-specific information, construction details, occupancy, geo-location, and insured values.\n- **Model Outputs:** Used to derive average annual losses, territory relativities, and net reinsurance allocations.\n- **Sensitivity Testing:** Conducted to assess the impact of model criteria, particularly excluding Demand Surge and Storm Surge.\n\n**6.

Rate Calculation Methodology:**\nThe rate increases are calculated by aggregating factors including profit load, modeled loss ratios, expense ratios, and trend factors. The selected rate change of 27.8% is derived from an indicated rate change of 34% adjusted for data corrections and internal calculations.\n\n**10. Policyholder Distribution:**\nThe filing provides a detailed distribution of policyholders by county within Maryland, ensuring transparency in how rate changes impact different regions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAmerican Strategic Insurance Corp.’s rate filing for Maryland Homeowners reflects a comprehensive approach to adjusting premiums based on actuarial analyses, CAT modeling, and expense considerations. The proposed 27.8% rate increase aims to align with the company’s financial targets while addressing loss trends and maintaining competitive positioning within the Maryland insurance market.

        "o1_mini_summary": "**Summary of Allstate Indemnity Company’s Rate Filing in South Carolina**\n\n**Company Overview:**\nAllstate Indemnity Company, a subsidiary of Allstate Corporation, operates in the property and casualty insurance sector. The company offers various insurance products, including homeowners and condominium homeowners insurance, tailored to different market segments and geographic regions.\n\n**Filing Details:**\n- **Product Name:** AI CON (Condominium Homeowners)\n- **State:** South Carolina\n- **Filing Type:** Rate Change\n- **Filing Number:** R57083\n- **Effective Dates:**\n  - **New Policies:** October 28, 2024\n  - **Renewal Policies:** December 12, 2024\n- **Rate Change:** Proposed increase of **19.0%**\n\n**Purpose of the Filing:**\nAllstate Indemnity Company is proposing a significant rate increase for its Condominium Homeowners insurance product in South Carolina. The primary objective is to adjust the Rate Adjustment Factor (RAF) and Coverage A amounts to align premiums with the company’s projected loss experience and expense provisions.\n\n**Key Components of the Filing:**\n\n1. **Rate Adjustment Factor (RAF):**\n   - **Current RAF:** 2.342\n   - **Proposed RAF:** 2.842\n   - **Impact:** The RAF adjustment facilitates a uniform premium increase without altering individual territorial base rates significantly.\n\n2. **Coverage Adjustments:**\n   - **Coverage A (Building Property Protection) Increased Limits:**\n     - **Current Buy-Up Premium for $100 Deductible:** $3.63\n     - **Proposed Buy-Up Premium for $100 Deductible:** $4.66\n     - **Percentage Change:** 28.4%\n     - Similar adjustments are made for other deductible levels, maintaining relativity between different deductible options.\n\n3. **Actuarial Basis and Methodology:**\n   - **Loss Modeling:** Utilizes AIR Worldwide’s Touchstone hurricane model (version 18.1.3) to simulate potential hurricane losses.\n   - **Loss Development Factors:** Applied using the Link Ratio method to estimate ultimate losses.\n   - **Trend Analysis:** Separate analysis for non-weather and weather-related losses, incorporating credibility procedures and actuarial judgment.\n   - **Expense Provisions:** Detailed provisions for fixed and variable expenses, including commissions, taxes, acquisition expenses, and underwriting profit.\n\n4. **Reinsurance Strategy:**\n   - **Net Cost of Reinsurance (NCOR):** Represents the incremental cost of reinsurance contracts, calculated as expected premiums minus expected recoveries.\n   - **Reinsurance Contracts:** A mix of traditional reinsurance and Insurance-Linked Securities (ILS) contracts placed to manage catastrophe exposure, particularly for hurricanes.\n\n5. **Objections and Responses:**\n   - **Department of Insurance Objections:** Addressed concerns regarding overlap in loss adjustment fees, sufficiency of catastrophe loss data, and justification for rate increases despite favorable underwriting results.\n   - **Resolution:** Comprehensive responses and supporting documentation were provided, leading to the approval of the filing on January 29, 2025.\n\n6. **Financial Impact:**\n   - **Written Premium Change:** An increase of approximately $4,050,873.\n   - **Number of Policyholders Affected:** 7,884.\n   - **Maximum and Minimum Rate Changes:** Up to 24.5% increase with a minimum change of 7.8%.\n\n**Competitive Implications:**\n- **Market Positioning:** A 19% rate increase positions Allstate Indemnity Company to better manage increased risk and expense projections, particularly from hurricane-related losses.\n- **Policyholder Impact:** Significant premium hikes may affect policyholder retention and acquisition, especially in regions with high exposure to natural catastrophes.\n- **Reinsurance Dependence:** The robust reinsurance strategy underscores Allstate's commitment to mitigating large-scale loss events, potentially offering more stable long-term pricing despite short-term rate increases.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAllstate Indemnity Company’s rate filing for the AI CON product in South Carolina reflects a strategic adjustment to address rising loss costs and ensure financial stability amid heightened exposure to catastrophic events. The comprehensive actuarial analysis, coupled with a strong reinsurance program, supports the proposed 19% rate increase. While this adjustment may enhance the company’s risk management and profitability, it also poses challenges in maintaining competitiveness and policyholder satisfaction in the regional market.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- **Compliance:** The filing adheres to relevant Actuarial Standards of Practice and South Carolina Department of Insurance regulations.\n- **Documentation:** Extensive attachments and exhibits provide detailed methodological support, including actuarial memoranda, loss development factors, expense provisions, and reinsurance summaries.\n\n**Strategic Considerations for Competitors:**\nInsurers operating in the same market segment should monitor Allstate’s adjustments closely, as a substantial rate increase may create opportunities for competitors to attract policyholders through more competitive pricing. Additionally, understanding Allstate’s reinsurance and catastrophe modeling approaches can inform risk management and pricing strategies within the industry.",
        "xai_summary": "The rate filing submitted by Allstate Indemnity Company to the South Carolina Department of Insurance proposes a 19.0% overall rate level increase for their Condominium Homeowners product, named AI CON. The filing was submitted on August 16, 2024, and was approved on January 29, 2025, with the new and renewal effective dates being October 28, 2024, and December 12, 2024, respectively.\n\n**Key Points of the Filing:**\n\n1. **Rate Increase Justification:**\n   - The proposed rate change is based on a comprehensive analysis of historical and projected loss experiences, adjusted for various factors such as loss development, loss trends, and expenses.\n   - The filing uses the AIR Worldwide Touchstone 2022 US Hurricane Model Version 18.1.3 to account for hurricane losses, which were removed from historical data and replaced with a modeled provision.\n\n2. **Rate Adjustment Factor (RAF):**\n   - The RAF is being updated from 2.342 to 2.842 to achieve the targeted 19.0% increase. The RAF is used as an offset factor to uniformly revise policyholder premiums without changing individual territorial base rates.\n\n3. **Coverage A Increased Limits Premium:**\n   - The premium for increased limits on Coverage A (Building Property Protection) is being modified. The buy-up premium for a $100 deductible is proposed to change from $3.63 to $4.57 per $1,000 of increased limit, resulting in a 25.9% increase. For a $250 deductible, the buy-up premium is proposed to increase from $3.25 to $4.09, resulting in a 25.8% increase.\n\n4. **Rate Changes by Premium Type:**\n   - Variable Package Premium: 21.3% increase\n   - Fixed Expense Premium: No change\n   - Additional Coverages - Coverage A: 25.9% increase\n   - Additional Coverages - Excluding Coverage A: No change\n   - Net Cost of Reinsurance (NCOR): No change\n\n5. **Supporting Documentation:**\n   - The filing includes various exhibits and attachments that detail the methodology and data used in the rate level indication, including loss development factors, loss trends, expense provisions, and reinsurance costs.\n   - Actuarial standards of practice were followed, and the filing was prepared by Alexander Robinson, FCAS, who confirmed compliance with relevant actuarial standards.\n\n6. **Reinsurance Considerations:**\n   - The filing accounts for the net cost of reinsurance, which is calculated based on the expected reinsurance premium and expected recoveries. This is allocated to the state and line of business level using modeled losses.\n\n7. **Objections and Responses:**\n   - The filing faced several objections from the Department of Insurance, primarily concerning the justification of the rate increase, the overlap of loss adjustment expenses, and the need for historical and prospective loss trend data. Allstate responded to these objections with detailed explanations and supporting documentation.\n\nThe filing aims to ensure that the rates reflect the expected costs accurately and fairly distribute the rate change across different components of the premium. The increase is intended to cover rising loss costs and maintain adequate underwriting results in the face of changing risk environments."

State Farm’s underwriting guidelines are not disclosed outside of State Farm, except pursuant to\nconfidentiality agreements or filings made with regulators in which State Farm has claimed confidentiality.  The underwriting\nguidelines are treated as confidential under limited distribution within State Farm to those with a need to know or access the\ninformation.  State Farm takes measures to safeguard its underwriting guidelines.  State Farm labels the underwriting\nguidelines as trade secret and has an enterprise policy on trade secrets and confidential information applicable to all of its\nemployees and agents that specifies underwriting guidelines, policies and procedures as examples of trade secrets within\nState Farm.  Underwriting guidelines are clearly valuable to State Farm and to State Farm’s competitors.  Without access\nthrough public disclosure by the Department, State Farm’s competitors could not duplicate or acquire State Farm’s\nunderwriting guidelines.  Finally, State Farm’s underwriting guidelines have been developed over many years and State Farm\nhas expended significant amounts of effort, money and personnel in developing the eligibility criteria and underwriting\njudgments built into the underwriting guidelines.\nOur submission of this information is not intended, and should not be construed, as any waiver by State Farm of either the\nconfidentiality or trade secret status of the underwriting guidelines and eligibility criteria.

Obviously, such information is critical to State Farm’s continuing operation and\nwould be immensely valuable to State Farm’s competitors.  Providing State Farm’s competitors with this type of information, at\nno cost, for them to use to State Farm’s competitive disadvantage is grossly unfair and anticompetitive.  Public release of this\ninformation would defeat State Farm’s consistent efforts to keep this information confidential and out of State Farm’s\ncompetitors hands and would destroy its trade secret value, not only in Texas, but in other states where the same guidelines\nare in use, and therefore would constitute an unconstitutional taking of our trade secret property rights without just\ncompensation under both state and federal law.\nState Farm also believes that underwriting guidelines and eligibility criteria should not be made public as a matter of public\npolicy, because disclosure could disrupt the healthy functioning of market competition in the insurance market.  If State Farm’s\nunderwriting guidelines and eligibility criteria were made public, competitors could use those underwriting materials instead of\ntheir own in an effort to duplicate State Farm’s success in the residential property insurance market.  The result would be more\nhomogeneity in the type of risks written in that market, less responsiveness to diverse market demands, and diminished\navailability and variety in products and services.  Companies need incentives to spend the time, effort and money necessary to\ndevelop new and innovative products which provide them with competitive advantages over their competitors.  Freely\ndisclosing a company’s underwriting guidelines to its competitors removes important incentives for a company to expend the\nmoney and effort necessary to differentiate itself and diversify by means of its underwriting guidelines and eligibility criteria.\nThe public interest is not served by disclosing an insurer’s valuable proprietary trade secret information to its competitors and\nrisking a disruption in the residential property insurance market.\nState Farm requests that the Department keep the enclosed materials separate from files which are open to public access or\ninspection.  Should any request be made to review any of our underwriting guidelines on file with the Department, we\nrespectfully request prior notice and an opportunity to demonstrate, in the appropriate administrative or judicial forum, that this\ninformation is a trade secret, confidential by law, that may not be made public by the Department.\nWe appreciate your attention to our claim of confidentiality over State Farm’s underwriting guidelines and we appreciate your\ncooperation in keeping them confidential.\nSincerely,\nMatthew Cairo\n309-735-1571\nhome.f.mail.394n00@statefarm.com\nKent M Shoaf\n844-275-7522\nKent.m.shoaf.hawt@statefarm.com",

Should any request be made to review any of our underwriting guidelines on file with the Department, we\nrespectfully request prior notice and an opportunity to demonstrate, in the appropriate administrative or judicial forum, that this\ninformation is a trade secret, confidential by law, that may not be made public by the Department.\nWe appreciate your attention to our claim of confidentiality over State Farm’s underwriting guidelines and we appreciate your\ncooperation in keeping them confidential.\nSincerely,\nMatthew Cairo\n309-735-1571\nhome.f.mail.394n00@statefarm.com\nKent M Shoaf\n844-275-7522\nhome.f.mail.394n00@statefarm.com",
