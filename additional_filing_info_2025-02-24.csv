rate change on a California Department of Insurance (CDI) Maximum indication of +21.9%. The last Home Advantage AARP
Program rate change was effective 10/19/20 (State Tracking # 20-716), and the “Mitigation in Rating Plans Regulation” filing
was approved and effective 9/3/24 (State Tracking # 23-1131).
The Hartford introduced by peril rating with the introduction of the Home Advantage class plan in April 2012. Coverage for all
specified perils is included in our homeowners product (i.e. no peril coverage is optional). With the introduction of by peril rating
we have been monitoring loss performance and have deemed it necessary to adjust the Building and Tenant form rates.  We
have seen increased loss ratios from Wildfire since this rate plan was introduced. This proposed change will attempt to
balance the Building form loss ratios across perils closer to the overall state loss ratio. The overall Building forms rate increase
will be +17.3%. For Tenant we are adjusting the rate uniformly across perils by -4.9%, and for Condo we are adjusting the rate
uniformly across perils by +10.4%.
The CDI template methodology used to support the catastrophe adjustment factors is based on a 20-year historical average as
shown on supporting Exhibit 9. At this time, we are proposing a rate increase within the maximum indication based on the CDI
template methodology. Our view of rate need, when following standard industry practices of using catastrophe models and
reflecting reinsurance costs, produces a materially higher view of rate need than the CDI template.

Here are some key points:

1. **Rating Algorithm and Data Sources**: The objection letters highlight the need for additional details on the rating algorithm used, especially in Excel and PDF formats. Furthermore, the calculation methodologies, data sources, and how expenses are split need to be clearly explained and justified, particularly with respect to countrywide billing fees versus California-specific expenses.

2. **Exhibit Revisions and Accuracy**: There are requests for revisions in various exhibits to ensure accuracy and clarity. Specific concerns include ensuring that the exhibits accurately portray the premium by peril, distinguishing between fixed and variable fees, and providing clear calculations to justify proposed fees and calculations.

3. **Model Usage and Updates**: The objection letters raise questions regarding the use of models and the need for clarity on when these models were last updated. Additionally, model checklists and explanations on how the models are applied in the rating process are required.

4. **Competitor Analysis and Justification**: Providing competitor information to support the proposed fees is advised. Comparing these fees to industry standards can help justify the proposed changes and ensure alignment with the California marketplace.

5. **Response and Resolution**: In order to address the objections effectively, clear and detailed responses are required from the filing company. Providing comprehensive explanations, supporting calculations, and revised exhibits where necessary will be essential to facilitate the approval process.

However, the Division of Rate Counsel intervened with objections and analysis suggesting that the rate increase should be no more than 14.7% based on various factors such as changes in loss trends, investment returns, catastrophe modeling, and other considerations.

The objections raised by the Rate Counsel included discrepancies in proposed dollar effects, unsupported return on equity values, unreasonably low investment return assumptions, inconsistencies in historical and prospective trends, and the need for a rate stabilization cap. The Rate Counsel also requested further clarification on the drivers of the indicated rate need, rationale behind the proposed rate filing amount, and risk profiles impacted by the changes.

In response to the objections, the company submitted revised exhibits and documents to address the issues raised. These included ensuring consistency between proposed dollar effects and overall impact percentages, updating ULAE data through 2023, revising severity trend values, and providing explanations for the discrepancies in rate changes for specific policy types.

Key changes include the replacement of coverage details for other structures, the addition of exclusions for continuous or repeated seepage or leakage of water or steam, and the introduction of an exclusion for cosmetic loss or damage to exterior surface materials and related components.

The amendment introduces explicit definitions for what constitutes cosmetic loss or damage, detailing various scenarios such as dents, spatter marks, scratching, and discoloration. It specifies that this exclusion applies as long as the affected materials maintain their function as a protective barrier against the elements, without compromising their integrity. The exclusion itemizes examples of cosmetic issues that will not be covered under the policy.

Furthermore, the filing includes additional details about the exclusion of cosmetic loss or damage, emphasizing the need for maintaining the function of exterior surface materials and related components, while not covering damages that purely alter the physical appearance without affecting their protective capabilities. This provision aims to clarify the scope of coverage and delineate what types of cosmetic damages will not be covered by the policy.
