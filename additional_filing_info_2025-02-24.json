Coverage for all\nspecified perils is included in our homeowners product (i.e. no peril coverage is optional). With the introduction of by peril rating\nwe have been monitoring loss performance and have deemed it necessary to adjust the Building and Tenant form rates.  We\nhave seen increased loss ratios from Wildfire since this rate plan was introduced. This proposed change will attempt to\nbalance the Building form loss ratios across perils closer to the overall state loss ratio. The overall Building forms rate increase\nwill be +17.3%. For Tenant we are adjusting the rate uniformly across perils by -4.9%, and for Condo we are adjusting the rate\nuniformly across perils by +10.4%.\nThe CDI template methodology used to support the catastrophe adjustment factors is based on a 20-year historical average as\nshown on supporting Exhibit 9. At this time, we are proposing a rate increase within the maximum indication based on the CDI\ntemplate methodology. Our view of rate need, when following standard industry practices of using catastrophe models and\nreflecting reinsurance costs, produces a materially higher view of rate need than the CDI template.\nThe trend selections by form consider both loss and premium trends and are based on the most appropriate net trend of the\nfive possible point fits (8, 12, 16, 20, and 24).

Additionally, model checklists and explanations on how the models are applied in the rating process are required.\n\n4. **Competitor Analysis and Justification**: Providing competitor information to support the proposed fees is advised.

        "gpt_3_5_summary": "Based on the filing, St. Paul Protective Insurance Company submitted a rate revision for their Quantum Homeowners 2.0 program to the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance. The proposed overall rate increase was 40.0%, with an annual premium increase of approximately $73.7 million affecting 146,837 policyholders. However, the Division of Rate Counsel intervened with objections and analysis suggesting that the rate increase should be no more than 14.7% based on various factors such as changes in loss trends, investment returns, catastrophe modeling, and other considerations.\n\nThe objections raised by the Rate Counsel included discrepancies in proposed dollar effects, unsupported return on equity values, unreasonably low investment return assumptions, inconsistencies in historical and prospective trends, and the need for a rate stabilization cap. The Rate Counsel also requested further clarification on the drivers of the indicated rate need, rationale behind the proposed rate filing amount, and risk profiles impacted by the changes.\n\nIn response to the objections, the company submitted revised exhibits and documents to address the issues raised. These included ensuring consistency between proposed dollar effects and overall impact percentages, updating ULAE data through 2023, revising severity trend values, and providing explanations for the discrepancies in rate changes for specific policy types.\n\nOverall, the Rate Counsel's analysis and objections highlight the importance of thorough actuarial and underwriting considerations in rate filings to ensure fair and justified premium adjustments for policyholders.",

It specifies that this exclusion applies as long as the affected materials maintain their function as a protective barrier against the elements, without compromising their integrity. The exclusion itemizes examples of cosmetic issues that will not be covered under the policy.\n\nFurthermore, the filing includes additional details about the exclusion of cosmetic loss or damage, emphasizing the need for maintaining the function of exterior surface materials and related components, while not covering damages that purely alter the physical appearance without affecting their protective capabilities. This provision aims to clarify the scope of coverage and delineate what types of cosmetic damages will not be covered by the policy.\n\nIn addition to these specific changes, the filing also touches on the rate filing associated with these amendments, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview of the adjustments made to the coverage and exclusions within the Quality Select Homeowners policy.",
