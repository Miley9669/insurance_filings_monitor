ongoing enhancements in the loss settlement process.  We also invest and participate in many loss prevention and control
activities.  Attached is an exhibit that outlines some of these activities.

HART-133954912,Rate/Rule,01/19/2024,05/15/2025,05/15/2025,Closed-Approved,"The Hartford Personal Lines respectfully submits for your approval the enclosed Homeowners rate filing for a +16.5% overall
rate change on a California Department of Insurance (CDI) Maximum indication of +21.9%. The last Home Advantage AARP
Program rate change was effective 10/19/20 (State Tracking # 20-716), and the “Mitigation in Rating Plans Regulation” filing
was approved and effective 9/3/24 (State Tracking # 23-1131).
The Hartford introduced by peril rating with the introduction of the Home Advantage class plan in April 2012. Coverage for all
specified perils is included in our homeowners product (i.e. no peril coverage is optional). With the introduction of by peril rating
we have been monitoring loss performance and have deemed it necessary to adjust the Building and Tenant form rates.  We
have seen increased loss ratios from Wildfire since this rate plan was introduced. This proposed change will attempt to
balance the Building form loss ratios across perils closer to the overall state loss ratio. The overall Building forms rate increase
will be +17.3%. For Tenant we are adjusting the rate uniformly across perils by -4.9%, and for Condo we are adjusting the rate
uniformly across perils by +10.4%.
The CDI template methodology used to support the catastrophe adjustment factors is based on a 20-year historical average as
shown on supporting Exhibit 9. At this time, we are proposing a rate increase within the maximum indication based on the CDI
template methodology. Our view of rate need, when following standard industry practices of using catastrophe models and
reflecting reinsurance costs, produces a materially higher view of rate need than the CDI template.
The trend selections by form consider both loss and premium trends and are based on the most appropriate net trend of the
five possible point fits (8, 12, 16, 20, and 24). Form level trend explanations are included in supporting Exhibit 8.",,04.0 Homeowners,91,"[34690, 11000, 27120, 29459]",2025-02-24,,,

Company (APC) Owners program in the state of Maryland. The overall rate level change was achieved through revisions to the
Rate Adjustment Factor. Information is also provided to support the revision of the distinct charge to cover the hurricane and
fire following earthquake portion of the net cost of  reinsurance in Allstate Property and Casualty Insurance Company for the
Owners program in the state of Maryland. The net cost of reinsurance is equal to the expected reinsurance premium less
expected reinsurance recoveries under the contract.
Allstate’s revised reinsurance cost will be reflected by revising the Reinsurance Rate Adjustment Factor in the rate calculation
for the Owners program. The revised Reinsurance Rate Adjustment Factor will apply to the calculation of the reinsurance
charge for all policies and will therefore have the same effect as a reinsurance base rate change. Because the same
Reinsurance Rate Adjustment Factor will apply to the calculation of all reinsurance charges, this filing will not change the
relative level of the charges by zone, construction type, or deductible.
