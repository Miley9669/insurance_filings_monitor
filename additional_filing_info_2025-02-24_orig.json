The last Home Advantage AARP\nProgram rate change was effective 10/19/20 (State Tracking # 20-716), and the “Mitigation in Rating Plans Regulation” filing\nwas approved and effective 9/3/24 (State Tracking # 23-1131).\nThe Hartford introduced by peril rating with the introduction of the Home Advantage class plan in April 2012. Coverage for all\nspecified perils is included in our homeowners product (i.e. no peril coverage is optional). With the introduction of by peril rating\nwe have been monitoring loss performance and have deemed it necessary to adjust the Building and Tenant form rates.  We\nhave seen increased loss ratios from Wildfire since this rate plan was introduced. This proposed change will attempt to\nbalance the Building form loss ratios across perils closer to the overall state loss ratio. The overall Building forms rate increase\nwill be +17.3%. For Tenant we are adjusting the rate uniformly across perils by -4.9%, and for Condo we are adjusting the rate\nuniformly across perils by +10.4%.\nThe CDI template methodology used to support the catastrophe adjustment factors is based on a 20-year historical average as\nshown on supporting Exhibit 9. At this time, we are proposing a rate increase within the maximum indication based on the CDI\ntemplate methodology. Our view of rate need, when following standard industry practices of using catastrophe models and\nreflecting reinsurance costs, produces a materially higher view of rate need than the CDI template.\nThe trend selections by form consider both loss and premium trends and are based on the most appropriate net trend of the\nfive possible point fits (8, 12, 16, 20, and 24). Form level trend explanations are included in supporting Exhibit 8.",

The revisions included adjustments to premium modifiers and factors related to various aspects such as affinity, masonry, burglar alarm, central fire alarm, insurance score, insured age, and other rating parameters.\n\nThe company conducted a retrovalidation study to determine the appropriate credit factors to be used with the new Inflection credit model. The study analyzed data from 2020 to 2022 and adjusted the modeled credit factors to achieve rate neutrality, ensuring consistency with the existing book of business and maintaining rate levels for both new customers and renewals.\n\nThe rate filing process involved multiple revisions to rule and rate pages, as well as the replacement of manual pages to reflect the updated rules and factors. The filing was later acknowledged as withdrawn with the effective date requested for July 1, 2025, for both new and renewal policies. The disposition of the filing indicated a status of \"Withdrawn\" following the company's decision not to use the Inflection in its products.\n",
