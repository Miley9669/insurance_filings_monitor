This program has performed well with a relatively large book of business by Nevada standards. Losses have been decreasing for this book, and the Division estimates that even if the company has an expense ratio of 29.3% (the maximum calendar-year expense in the profitability report) in the next calendar year, then the company would be able to absorb losses in some excess of the largest loss ratio experienced over the last 5 years and still retain a 5-year profitability meeting or exceeding its profit provision of 11.3%. The Division's position is that a +3.0% rate impact for these lines provides the company enough rate to resume marketing expenditures, and along with the support of the excess profits from this program, the company will be able to absorb a short-term downturn in loss performance. Note that the Division has already agreed in principle to approving the proposed rate impact of +8.9% for the Tenant and Condo Forms. (ii) If the company is agreeable to the proposed impacts, then to effectuate these proposed rate impacts, please submit: (a) A post-submission update of the Rate/Rule Schedule tab; (b) Revised rate pages (clean and redlined) under the Rate/Rule Schedule tab; (c) A revised Filing Memorandum; (d) A revised Rate Disruption exhibit; and (e) A revised Rate Filing Data Summary on exhibits NV PC Form 1  Parts 1 and 2, and NV PC Form 5  Part 2.

NV_HART-133798836,NV,91,34690,[34690],05/22/2024,Objection_letter3,objection4,"Objection 4 Response (Supporting Document)           Comments: (i) In its response to the previous Objection #4, the company stated, ""its worth noting that our expense ratio exhibits a variation of up to seven percentage points over the five years of underlying data presented in the profitability report. This was a result of decreased marketing spend as loss costs have increased, which would not have existed in a typical year."" Does the company expect its marketing expenditures to stay at their current level, or to increase toward their previous level? (ii) The company stated in its response to the previous Objection #1, ""As we noticed our loss costs accelerate in late 2022 across all lines of business, we made the decision to stop spending on marketing"". The Division notes that the 2022 loss ratio of 64.6% was much lower than the company's stated permissible loss ratio of 72.7% and was even lower than the loss ratios for 2019 and 2020. So, while the company has stated that increased loss costs were the reason for the decreased marketing expenditures, it appears to the Division that the performance of this book of business does not correlate to the reduced expense load, but rather to the aggregate performance of many lines of business countrywide in the company's extensive portfolio. The Division is willing to consider a higher expense load when determining an appropriate rate; however, the Division is wary of approving a rate increase to account for an expense load that may not materialize, and it seems to the Division that an additional rate increase will not affect the decision to increase marketing expenditures. Please provide additional commentary addressing these concerns. (iii) The company's permissible loss ratio of 72.7% is greater than the loss ratio for each accident year for the Building Forms and the total book of business in the Profitability Report, where the total 5-year loss ratio was at 59.0% for the building forms and 60.6% for the total book of business, indicating that the rate level has been adequate for this book of business for the nearly four years since the last rate increase effective 9/4/2020 for renewal business. (iv) The Division notes that the company's use of the AIR/Verisk Wildfire Model, Touchstone v8, does not comply with the stipulations for use of that model in Nevada. Moreover, the Division will not consider for approval a rate indication which uses the model to generate a CAT Load. (v) Taking into consideration the company's position on its expense load, the Division would be amenable to approving a rate increase for the Building Forms of up to +3.0% to maintain profitability at or above the profit provision. If the company is agreeable to this rate proposal, then to effectuate all proposed rate impacts (including the +8.9% increase in the Tenant and Condo Forms which the Division previously agreed to in objection #3-1(i)), please submit: (a) A Post-Submission Update of the Rate/Rule Schedule tab; (b) Revised rate pages (clean and redlined) under the Rate/Rule Schedule tab; (c) A revised Filing Memorandum; SERFF Tracking #: HART-133798836 State Tracking #: 116080 Company Tracking #: FN.14.799/RWG.2023.02 State: Nevada Filing Company: Property and Casualty Insurance Company of Hartford TOI/Sub-TOI: 04.0 Homeowners/04.0000 Homeowners Sub-TOI Combinations Product Name: NV Home PLIC 2000 - PCIC Project Name/Number: NV Home PLIC 2000 - PCIC/FN.14.799/RWG.2023.02 PDF Pipeline for SERFF Tracking Number HART-133798836 Generated 08/07/2024 12:20 AM  (d) A revised Rate Disruption exhibit; and (e) A revised Rate Filing Data Summary on exhibits NV PC Form 1  Part 1 and 2, and Form 5  Part 2.

Currently the Profitability Report only extends through 12/31/2022, which is insufficiently recent to reflect current conditions. (ii) The expense ratios in the Profitability Report are the same by coverage for each year. This means that the company appears to be using an assumed a priori expense ratio instead of following the instructions of the Profitability Report, which state, ""Expenses should be actual dollar figures incurred in Nevada by coverage and by year, not based on an assumed a priori expense ratio."" Please follow these instructions and start with actual dollar expenses incurred in Nevada (column (F)), from which the ratios in column (G) should be derived. The dollar expenses should be primary and the ratios derived from them, not the other way around. By this approach, expenses should vary not only by year, but also by coverage. (iii) The Profitability Report shows 9.1% profitability for the Building Forms for the last 5 years with a large spike of 24% two years ago for the year 2021, and the company's proposed rate-level change for the Building Forms is 14.0%. Please justify why the company is proposing such a large rate change when the company is near double-digit 5-year profitability for these forms. Note that any adverse experience from the 2023 calendar year would be expressed with a more up-to-date Profitability Report. (iv) Regarding the company's comment on the Filing Memorandum that ""As we are barred from contemplating [wildfire risk] potential in our Profitability Report, there will be a disconnect between the unloaded/untrended prior profitability outlined in the Report and the loaded/trended permissible loss ratio contemplated in our indication"", it is unclear how this wildfire risk potential ties to the rate changes proposed, considering that this rate change proposal is applied evenly to the base rates for every peril, not just the wildfire peril. Please explain the connection between this wildfire risk model's results and the proposed base rate changes, and please explain why each peril is receiving the same base-rate change per form."

The S04 and S05 Insurance Score Tiers are both below the 30% percentile in their entirety based on the company's Insurance Score Group Assignment for each Percentile table, which ""is representative of the distribution of risks in the Nevada market."" The Nevada Division of Insurance requires a no-worse-than-neutral treatment of credit no- hits and thin files. Accordingly, please change the Insurance Score Tier assignments to at least the S02 tier so that No-Hit/No-Score applicants or policyholders are placed no worse than the median policyholder. The Division has not ""otherwise approved"" any worse-than-neutral treatment of credit no-hits and thin files since 2009, and will not make an exception in this case. A no-worse-than-neutral treatment, as required pursuant to NRS 686A.680(1)(e)(2), has been the consistent expectation across insurers."

However, the company's proposed base rates on the rate pages show increases in the vicinity of 14.5% and 12.6%, respectively, for each territory. There is an excess of around $3-$4 for each territory rate compared to the company's proposed overall base-rate change. For example, the rate for territory 12 is proposed to be raised from $754 to $863 for Building, an increase of 14.46%, and from $96 to $108 for Tenant/Condo, an increase of 12.50%. A Building base rate of $859.56 would match the company's proposed 14.0% increase, $3.44 less than the proposed base rate $863.

However, the following issues will require your attention.      Objection 1           - Rule Pages- Revised , null (Rate)           Comments: Pursuant to Chapter 345 of Title 14 of the Virginia Administrative code, each source of renewals must be clearly stated in the rule filing. Please refer to Rule 847. Remove ""this rule applies to policies converting from a non-Hartford company that are a part of an approved acquisition or book of business transfer or for existing Hartford policies for which a new rate plan is being introduced."" Any time the company wishes to use this process, it must complete and certify a separate filing when the book transfer ""group"" is different. The current phrasing implies that the company will use the rate capping program on other policies. Please refer to Rule 897. Chapter 345 states ""B. A rate stabilization plan shall be unambiguous and applied uniformly and fairly to all renewal policies affected by such plan."" As such, having two different procedures for the phasing out of the rate capping program is unacceptable. Ensure that there is only one rate capping procedure, regardless of renewal date. Additionally, the rate capping program must have a specified beginning and end date - it is not acceptable to consistently cap policies anytime a rate increases. It would be acceptable for the company to begin rate capping starting 6/1/24 and concluding 6/1/29. The beginning and end date for these rate caps must be clearly stated in the rules. All policies must have the same rate cap applied beginning at the same point in time."
