Consistent with the File and Use method and requirements to file not less than 30\ndays before the effective date in the statute, we processed the revised rates on 12/15/2024 to be available for use for new business\non 1/15/2025 and renewal business on 3/15/2025. With our revised rates currently implemented after the 30 days the superintendent\nhas to act, we will continue with our originally communicated effective dates of 1/15/2025 and 3/15/2025, respectively. If the Bureau\nbelieves that State Farm has misinterpreted the states filing laws, please provide what authority the Bureau is relying on, and we\nwould be welcome to arrange a call to further discuss your request.\nThe superintendent did act in the form of objections. Maine is a file for approval with a 30 deemer clause not \"file and use\". Title 24-A,\n§2304-A. states that filing will be made public once they are approved. Section 5 carves out only specially rate inland marine risks\nwhich is not what this filing is. The SERFF rules making this clear are below.\nAvailable Filing Modes:\nPrior Approval\n 24-A M.R.S. §§ 2304-A and 2412 state that filings are to be made no less than 30 days in advance of their stated effective/delivery\ndate.\n Filings may be deemed approved if the filing is not acted upon within 30 days.
