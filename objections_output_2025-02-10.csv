If necessary, a new effective date must be requested in your response, which must again allow for at least a 30-day waiting period following its receipt by the division. The response must identify any changes to the filing; see 3 AAC 31.210(p).

If neither a response nor a written request for a 15-day extension is received within 30 days from the date of this letter, the division will disapprove the filing and the filing shall not become effective.  A response received after the expiration of the response period must be a complete resubmission of the filing, which specifically addresses the above questions and comments and references the tracking number; 3 AAC 31.210(i).  The response must be received before 3:00pm Alaska time (6:00pm Central) on the due date. If a response is received after 3:00 pm Alaska time (6:00 pm Central) or on a weekend or state holiday, the receipt date is the next working day as required by 3 AAC 31.205(b).

Please review and respond to the following objection(s).      Objection 1           Comments: Please be advised that State Farm submitted this filing via the File and Use method on 10/4/2024, per the Companys understanding of Title 24-A, §2304-A. Consistent with the File and Use method and requirements to file not less than 30 days before the effective date in the statute, we processed the revised rates on 12/15/2024 to be available for use for new business on 1/15/2025 and renewal business on 3/15/2025. With our revised rates currently implemented after the 30 days the superintendent has to act, we will continue with our originally communicated effective dates of 1/15/2025 and 3/15/2025, respectively. If the Bureau believes that State Farm has misinterpreted the states filing laws, please provide what authority the Bureau is relying on, and we would be welcome to arrange a call to further discuss your request. The superintendent did act in the form of objections. Maine is a file for approval with a 30 deemer clause not ""file and use"". Title 24-A, §2304-A. states that filing will be made public once they are approved. Section 5 carves out only specially rate inland marine risks which is not what this filing is. The SERFF rules making this clear are below. Available Filing Modes: Prior Approval  24-A M.R.S. §§ 2304-A and 2412 state that filings are to be made no less than 30 days in advance of their stated effective/delivery date.  Filings may be deemed approved if the filing is not acted upon within 30 days. Acted upon means approved, disapproved, rejected, withdrawn, an objection letter, an extension granted, or there has been a request for additional information Please update this filings effective date so I can approve it.",2025-02-10
