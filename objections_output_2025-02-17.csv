AZ_FARM-134267371,Form,10/02/2024,Closed-Form Approved,AZ,69,21598,[21598],11/01/2024,Objection_letter3,objection7,"Equipment Breakdown Coverage; The Department objects to including service contract coverages in an insurance policy, within the same policy document. Service contracts are regulated under different laws under Title 20 regulations and require the obligor to obtain a permit to engage in the service contract business. Additionally, a service contract requires a separate consideration from the one for an insurance contract. There must be a clear distinction between the two types of coverage and how each affects consumers rights and obligations. Pursuant to ARS 20-1095 et seq. an entity issuing service contracts needs to obtain a permit in order to do so. Issuing service contracts without the appropriate registration constitutes an unlicensed activity and is prohibited by law. Additionally, combining two disassociated coverages within the same policy without notice that the consumer is entering into two separate coverage contracts causes consumer harm and confusion and is in violation of Arizonas Unfair Practices Act. See ARS 20- 443, 461. An insurance policy coverage is distinct and separate from the ones of a service contract and each can affect a consumers rights and obligations differently. In this case, Farmers Insurance Company of Arizona and Policy Form 93-7726 and any other forms that contain similar coverages, does not comply with the statutory provisions cited above. The company does not hold a service company permit and is not authorized to sell service contracts in Arizona. Furthermore, the current form filing includes both insurance coverage and service contract coverage within the same form without any explanations or information relating to the differences between the two coverages which will cause consumer confusion. Any claims under an insurance policy are treated differently from those under a service contract and the implications for a consumer under each coverage are very distinct. Without clearly explaining the differences and providing sufficient information to a consumer to make a well-informed decision, the current form language misrepresents pertinent facts and insurance policy provisions relating to coverage. The Department objects to the current form language. This filing will remain open until such time as this language is removed.  In addition any related Rate or Rule filings will need to be revised or withdrawn.

Thank you for providing the new program filing #. I learned, after going back to filing #15-228, that the territory factors were developed using actual California industry losses and modeled losses which consisted of premium and loss data reported to ISO. The ISO Fast Track industry data represents data consolidated from reporting by individual companies. The ISO fast track combined data takes fire/wildfire risks into account. This means that your original territory rates were developed with data that accounts for wildfire/fire risk exposures. Please remove the territory factor, provide support for your current territory factor (by matching rate to risk based on expected future loss cost at segment level or using loss ratios), or submit a rule filing to implement the Wildfire Mitigation Discounts into this HOU program. a. If you decide you are removing the territory factor and determine that you do not rate in whole or in part using wildfire risks, then provide the following Attestation letter via ""Note to Filer"" with the following subject line ""Wildfire Mitigation Discount - Attestation Letter"". Please note that an Attestation letter is required for all subsequent rate filings. The submission should follow this same format with a ""Note to Filer"", same attestation wording, and with the same subject line. “I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California, that [Company Name]’s [Program Name], related to filing #[XX-XXXX], does not apply or use rate(s) that are developed with, determined by or relies upon, in whole or in part, a rating plan that segments, creates a rate differential, or surcharges the premium based upon a policyholder or applicant’s wildfire risk.” b. For reasons stated in #2 (above), the ISO complement data is not appropriate to use in this filing. Please choose another complement to be used in Exhibit 8 for both the (Including NR and Excluding NR) standard exhibits.",2025-02-17

As we responded in the recent objection letter which we submitted to the Encompass personal auto filing, we will need the company to update Attachment H and provide the General Expense and Other Acquisition Expense percentages for 2023.  Attachment H presents what seems to be a glaring statement that something has changed between 2020-2021 and 2022.  The percentages for both General Expense and Other Acquisition are nearly identical for 2020 and 2021 with General Expense at 15.1% and Other Acquisition at 3.9% but they suddenly dip down quite significantly in 2022 to 10.4% and 3.1% respectively.  Because it is highly improbable that this change in one year is due to naturally expected fluctuations, it seems more likely that a change has occurred in which the lower expenses will continue into the future which includes the effective period of the new rates.  We suspect that 2023 expense data will answer the question of whether the lower expense levels will be expected to continue into the future or not and we are therefore asking for the updated 2023 expense percentages.  We realize this may be inconvenient to the company, however ASOP 29, Item 3.3 requires companies to provide updated expense data which will likely affect expense levels projected to be in force during the period in which the new rates are effective.

As we stated in our objection letter to the Encompass personal auto filing, ASOP 29, Item 3.3 in regard to incorporating expense provisions into indications analyses requires selections that are appropriate for the period the new rates will be effective.  It is understood that there will be some variation in ECI and CPI numbers month to month, but the annual averages should be fairly stable.  In addition, it is generally understood that these numbers track closely with inflation rates and there has been a significant downturn in the inflation rates from 2023 to late 2024.  We therefore request that the company update their selected numbers to be more in line with the current expectations for prospective fixed expense levels.

Minnesota does not permit the use of claims based on weather events to surcharge a homeowners policy. Minnesota Statute §65A.28, subd. 8 authorized the commissioner to promulgate rules to specify the grounds for nonrenewal, reduction in limits of coverage or elimination of coverage. The rules must limit the grounds to specific factors, one of which is the insureds loss experience, not to include natural causes. Minnesota Rules Chapter 2880 were promulgated under this authority. Under these rules a transfer from one rating plan to another, if the transfer results in a premium increase, is a nonrenewal. The rules set out specific conditions that, if met, would constitute nonrenewal, including a surcharge to a premium for a condition that increases the potential for loss. By implication, where the conditions are not met, the outcome would be inverted. That is, if the plan is transferred but there is no increase in premium, then a nonrenewal has not occurred. Likewise, a surcharge applied for any reason other than a condition that increases the potential for loss would be a nonrenewal. The statutory and regulatory frameworks draw a distinction between natural causes and conditions. This distinction matters. As discussed above, a surcharge based on a condition is specifically excluded from the nonrenewal definition in Minn. R. 2880.0100, subp. 5. However, the next section of Chapter 2880 makes clear that the conditions in question are those that can be remediated by the homeowner: No insurer shall refuse to renew a policy of homeowners insurance unless based on one or more reasons which shall be limited to the following  Refusal of the insured to eliminate known conditions which increase the potential for loss after notification by the insurer that the condition must be removed. (Minn. R. 2880.0200(E)) Likewise, Chapter 2880 provides clarity on what constitutes natural causes that, per Minn. Stat. §65A.29, cannot provide the basis of a nonrenewal decision. Minn. R. 2880.0200(G) states that losses caused by natural causes including but not limited to lightning, wind, or hail cannot be counted as losses during the experience period for the purposes of nonrenewal. What emerges is a clear distinction between those things in the control of the insured (conditions) and those not in the control of the insured (natural causes).",2025-02-17

We object to the extensive use of “Unknown” as if it is a risk classification. (We understand that it was allowed previously It is not acceptable to rate on characteristics for which you won’t ask an applicant for the information when it is unreturned from the third-party data source you used to populate it. ***If you file a manual page that defines “Unknown” in terms of the risk being asked to provide the information and only be used when the risk did not or could not provide it, then this would be acceptable.*** Otherwise: The use of “unknown” will result in policies with identical risk characteristics being charged different rates. Differences in rates must be based in differences in expected losses and expenses to not be unfairly discriminatory; please refer to 40 P.S. s. 1183(d). The use of “unknown” will also cause rates to be excessive for those risks whose characteristics qualify them for lower-rated classes. The use of “unknown” will also cause rates to be inadequate for those risks whose characteristics qualify them for higher-rated classes. And rates cannot be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory under state law. Additionally, ASOP No. 12 Risk Classification (for all Practice Areas) includes the following: - 3.2.3 OBJECTIVITY: “The actuary should select risk characteristics that are capable of being objectively determined.” - 3.3 CONSIDERATIONS IN ESTABLISHING RISK CLASSES: “A risk classification system assigns each risk to a risk class based on the results of measuring or observing its risk characteristics.” Finally, there have been discussions among state insurance regulators across the country about industry’s desire to rate on “unknown” and “missing”, and we believe most states are regulating this in the same or similar way.

For example, if the customer had 50/100 prior to 11/17/2024, they would be rated with code B and this will not change to code A at renewal (even if they renew after 11/17/2024). Therefore, an insured would not experience a premium increase at renewal for this variable as a result of this change. For this reason the rule of application in the filing is only applicable to New Business and states there is a 0% impact.
