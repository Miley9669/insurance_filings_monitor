Service\ncontracts are regulated under different laws under Title 20 regulations and require the obligor to obtain a permit to engage in the\nservice contract business. Additionally, a service contract requires a separate consideration from the one for an insurance contract.\nThere must be a clear distinction between the two types of coverage and how each affects consumers rights and obligations.\nPursuant to ARS 20-1095 et seq. an entity issuing service contracts needs to obtain a permit in order to do so. Issuing service\ncontracts without the appropriate registration constitutes an unlicensed activity and is prohibited by law.\nAdditionally, combining two disassociated coverages within the same policy without notice that the consumer is entering into two\nseparate coverage contracts causes consumer harm and confusion and is in violation of Arizonas Unfair Practices Act. See ARS 20-\n443, 461. An insurance policy coverage is distinct and separate from the ones of a service contract and each can affect a consumers\nrights and obligations differently.\nIn this case, Farmers Insurance Company of Arizona and Policy Form 93-7726 and any other forms that contain similar coverages,\ndoes not comply with the statutory provisions cited above. The company does not hold a service company permit and is not\nauthorized to sell service contracts in Arizona. Furthermore, the current form filing includes both insurance coverage and service\ncontract coverage within the same form without any explanations or information relating to the differences between the two coverages\nwhich will cause consumer confusion. Any claims under an insurance policy are treated differently from those under a service\ncontract and the implications for a consumer under each coverage are very distinct. Without clearly explaining the differences and\nproviding sufficient information to a consumer to make a well-informed decision, the current form language misrepresents pertinent\nfacts and insurance policy provisions relating to coverage.\nThe Department objects to the current form language.

This means that your original territory rates were developed with data that\naccounts for wildfire/fire risk exposures. Please remove the territory factor, provide support for your current territory factor (by\nmatching rate to risk based on expected future loss cost at segment level or using loss ratios), or submit a rule filing to implement the\nWildfire Mitigation Discounts into this HOU program.\na. If you decide you are removing the territory factor and determine that you do not rate in whole or in part using wildfire risks, then\nprovide the following Attestation letter via \"Note to Filer\" with the following subject line \"Wildfire Mitigation Discount - Attestation\nLetter\". Please note that an Attestation letter is required for all subsequent rate filings. The submission should follow this same format\nwith a \"Note to Filer\", same attestation wording, and with the same subject line. “I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of\nthe State of California, that [Company Name]’s [Program Name], related to filing #[XX-XXXX], does not apply or use rate(s) that are\ndeveloped with, determined by or relies upon, in whole or in part, a rating plan that segments, creates a rate differential, or\nsurcharges the premium based upon a policyholder or applicant’s wildfire risk.”\nb.

The percentages for\nboth General Expense and Other Acquisition are nearly identical for 2020 and 2021 with General Expense at 15.1% and Other\nAcquisition at 3.9% but they suddenly dip down quite significantly in 2022 to 10.4% and 3.1% respectively.

It is understood that there will be some variation in ECI and CPI numbers\nmonth to month, but the annual averages should be fairly stable.  In addition, it is generally understood that these numbers track\nclosely with inflation rates and there has been a significant downturn in the inflation rates from 2023 to late 2024.

Minnesota Statute\n§65A.28, subd. 8 authorized the commissioner to promulgate rules to specify the grounds for nonrenewal, reduction in limits of\ncoverage or elimination of coverage. The rules must limit the grounds to specific factors, one of which is the insureds loss experience,\nnot to include natural causes.\nMinnesota Rules Chapter 2880 were promulgated under this authority. Under these rules a transfer from one rating plan to another, if\nthe transfer results in a premium increase, is a nonrenewal. The rules set out specific conditions that, if met, would constitute\nnonrenewal, including a surcharge to a premium for a condition that increases the potential for loss. By implication, where the\nconditions are not met, the outcome would be inverted. That is, if the plan is transferred but there is no increase in premium, then a\nnonrenewal has not occurred. Likewise, a surcharge applied for any reason other than a condition that increases the potential for loss\nwould be a nonrenewal.\nThe statutory and regulatory frameworks draw a distinction between natural causes and conditions. This distinction matters. As\ndiscussed above, a surcharge based on a condition is specifically excluded from the nonrenewal definition in Minn. R. 2880.0100,\nsubp. 5. However, the next section of Chapter 2880 makes clear that the conditions in question are those that can be remediated by\nthe homeowner:\nNo insurer shall refuse to renew a policy of homeowners insurance unless based on one or more reasons which shall be limited to\nthe following  Refusal of the insured to eliminate known conditions which increase the potential for loss after notification by the insurer\nthat the condition must be removed. (Minn. R. 2880.0200(E))\nLikewise, Chapter 2880 provides clarity on what constitutes natural causes that, per Minn. Stat. §65A.29, cannot provide the basis of\na nonrenewal decision. Minn. R. 2880.0200(G) states that losses caused by natural causes including but not limited to lightning, wind,\nor hail cannot be counted as losses during the experience period for the purposes of nonrenewal. What emerges is a clear distinction\nbetween those things in the control of the insured (conditions) and those not in the control of the insured (natural causes).",

Minnesota Statute\n§65A.28, subd. 8 authorized the commissioner to promulgate rules to specify the grounds for nonrenewal, reduction in limits of\ncoverage or elimination of coverage. The rules must limit the grounds to specific factors, one of which is the insureds loss experience,\nnot to include natural causes.\nMinnesota Rules Chapter 2880 were promulgated under this authority. Under these rules a transfer from one rating plan to another, if\nthe transfer results in a premium increase, is a nonrenewal. The rules set out specific conditions that, if met, would constitute\nnonrenewal, including a surcharge to a premium for a condition that increases the potential for loss. By implication, where the\nconditions are not met, the outcome would be inverted. That is, if the plan is transferred but there is no increase in premium, then a\nnonrenewal has not occurred. Likewise, a surcharge applied for any reason other than a condition that increases the potential for loss\nwould be a nonrenewal.\nSERFF Tracking #: AMSI-133860491\nState Tracking #:\nCompany Tracking #: MN.MFH.2024.Q1\nState:\nMinnesota\nFiling Company:\nProgressive Preferred Insurance Company\nTOI/Sub-TOI:\n04.0 Homeowners/04.0002 Mobile Homeowners\nProduct Name:\nMN MFH\nProject Name/Number: MN MFH 202403/\nPDF Pipeline for SERFF Tracking Number AMSI-133860491 Generated 01/22/2025 03:29 AM\n\nThe statutory and regulatory frameworks draw a distinction between natural causes and conditions. This distinction matters. As\ndiscussed above, a surcharge based on a condition is specifically excluded from the nonrenewal definition in Minn. R. 2880.0100,\nsubp. 5. However, the next section of Chapter 2880 makes clear that the conditions in question are those that can be remediated by\nthe homeowner:\nNo insurer shall refuse to renew a policy of homeowners insurance unless based on one or more reasons which shall be limited to\nthe following  Refusal of the insured to eliminate known conditions which increase the potential for loss after notification by the insurer\nthat the condition must be removed. (Minn. R. 2880.0200(E))\nLikewise, Chapter 2880 provides clarity on what constitutes natural causes that, per Minn. Stat. §65A.29, cannot provide the basis of\na nonrenewal decision. Minn. R. 2880.0200(G) states that losses caused by natural causes including but not limited to lightning, wind,\nor hail cannot be counted as losses during the experience period for the purposes of nonrenewal. What emerges is a clear distinction\nbetween those things in the control of the insured (conditions) and those not in the control of the insured (natural causes).",

Differences in rates must\nbe based in differences in expected losses and expenses to not be unfairly discriminatory; please refer to 40 P.S. s. 1183(d).\nThe use of “unknown” will also cause rates to be excessive for those risks whose characteristics qualify them for lower-rated classes.\nThe use of “unknown” will also cause rates to be inadequate for those risks whose characteristics qualify them for higher-rated\nclasses.\nAnd rates cannot be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory under state law.\nAdditionally, ASOP No. 12 Risk Classification (for all Practice Areas) includes the following:\n- 3.2.3 OBJECTIVITY: “The actuary should select risk characteristics that are capable of being objectively determined.”\n- 3.3 CONSIDERATIONS IN ESTABLISHING RISK CLASSES: “A risk classification system assigns each risk to a risk class based\non the results of measuring or observing its risk characteristics.”\nFinally, there have been discussions among state insurance regulators across the country about industry’s desire to rate on\n“unknown” and “missing”, and we believe most states are regulating this in the same or similar way.\nSERFF Tracking #: USAA-134171931\nState Tracking #:\nCompany Tracking #: PA2400220\nState:\nPennsylvania\nFirst Filing Company:\nUnited Services Automobile Association, ...\nTOI/Sub-TOI:\n04.0 Homeowners/04.0000 Homeowners Sub-TOI Combinations\nProduct Name:\nPA Homeowners Rate/Rule Filing\nProject Name/Number: /2024-04-0008\nPDF Pipeline for SERFF Tracking Number USAA-134171931 Generated 02/11/2025 12:28 AM\n\n4.The previous",
