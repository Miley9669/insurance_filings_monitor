AZ_FARM-134267371,AZ,69,21598,[21598],11/01/2024,Objection_letter3,objection7,"Equipment Breakdown Coverage; The Department objects to including service contract coverages in an insurance policy, within the same policy document. Service contracts are regulated under different laws under Title 20 regulations and require the obligor to obtain a permit to engage in the service contract business. Additionally, a service contract requires a separate consideration from the one for an insurance contract. There must be a clear distinction between the two types of coverage and how each affects consumers rights and obligations. Pursuant to ARS 20-1095 et seq. an entity issuing service contracts needs to obtain a permit in order to do so. Issuing service contracts without the appropriate registration constitutes an unlicensed activity and is prohibited by law. Additionally, combining two disassociated coverages within the same policy without notice that the consumer is entering into two separate coverage contracts causes consumer harm and confusion and is in violation of Arizonas Unfair Practices Act. See ARS 20- 443, 461. An insurance policy coverage is distinct and separate from the ones of a service contract and each can affect a consumers rights and obligations differently. In this case, Farmers Insurance Company of Arizona and Policy Form 93-7726 and any other forms that contain similar coverages, does not comply with the statutory provisions cited above. The company does not hold a service company permit and is not authorized to sell service contracts in Arizona. Furthermore, the current form filing includes both insurance coverage and service contract coverage within the same form without any explanations or information relating to the differences between the two coverages which will cause consumer confusion. Any claims under an insurance policy are treated differently from those under a service contract and the implications for a consumer under each coverage are very distinct. Without clearly explaining the differences and providing sufficient information to a consumer to make a well-informed decision, the current form language misrepresents pertinent facts and insurance policy provisions relating to coverage. The Department objects to the current form language. This filing will remain open until such time as this language is removed.  In addition any related Rate or Rule filings will need to be revised or withdrawn.

Under these rules a transfer from one rating plan to another, if the transfer results in a premium increase, is a nonrenewal. The rules set out specific conditions that, if met, would constitute nonrenewal, including a surcharge to a premium for a condition that increases the potential for loss. By implication, where the conditions are not met, the outcome would be inverted. That is, if the plan is transferred but there is no increase in premium, then a nonrenewal has not occurred. Likewise, a surcharge applied for any reason other than a condition that increases the potential for loss would be a nonrenewal. The statutory and regulatory frameworks draw a distinction between natural causes and conditions. This distinction matters. As discussed above, a surcharge based on a condition is specifically excluded from the nonrenewal definition in Minn. R. 2880.0100, subp. 5. However, the next section of Chapter 2880 makes clear that the conditions in question are those that can be remediated by the homeowner: No insurer shall refuse to renew a policy of homeowners insurance unless based on one or more reasons which shall be limited to the following  Refusal of the insured to eliminate known conditions which increase the potential for loss after notification by the insurer that the condition must be removed. (Minn. R. 2880.0200(E)) Likewise, Chapter 2880 provides clarity on what constitutes natural causes that, per Minn. Stat. §65A.29, cannot provide the basis of a nonrenewal decision. Minn. R. 2880.0200(G) states that losses caused by natural causes including but not limited to lightning, wind, or hail cannot be counted as losses during the experience period for the purposes of nonrenewal. What emerges is a clear distinction between those things in the control of the insured (conditions) and those not in the control of the insured (natural causes).",2025-02-24

Please note that absolute exclusions for fungi/mold are not permitted in forms providing Personal Liability coverage per New Jersey Bulletin 03-24. As such, liability coverage should apply up to at least $50,000 on an aggregate basis with optional increased limits up to at least $100,000.

Please either amend the rate, rule, and/or form accordingly to comply with this requirement, explain where the policy provides this coverage, or remove the exclusion for fungi from the Landlord endorsement.

As shown below, there is only one sentence in the Mortgagee Clause that follows item f. and this sentence is separate from item f.

You stated that the last sentence (i.e., ""subrogation shall not impair the right of the mortgagee to recover the full amount of the mortgagees claim"") is not removed by this statement and therefore no changes need to be made, including the removal of the ""and following paragraph"" wording. As such, please identify what paragraph that follows item f. is being deleted that requires the ""and following paragraph"" language to be included in the Special Provisions endorsement.

Please note we asked that if the limit is the Coverage C limit that the endorsement be revised because, as we previously mentioned, the endorsement currently states the limit is a percentage of Coverage C (not Coverage A), which indicates the limit is less than Coverage C. For example, a similar World-Wide Coverage is included in the Landlord endorsement that was approved for Liberty Mutual Mid-Atlantic Ins Cos (LMMIC) Homeowners program under SERFF Tracking #LBPM-127348539 (Dept. File #11-1608), and in that endorsement the limit for this coverage was 10% of the Coverage C limit as shown in the endorsement. Based on previous responses, instead of having a limit that is 10% of the Coverage C limit similar to the approved endorsement for LMMIC, you are stating the proposed limit is 100% of the Coverage C limit (i.e., equal to the Coverage C limit). While it is not clear why the proposed endorsement would reference the limit as being a percentage of Coverage C when the limit is the Coverage C limit, if you wish to refer to the percentage shown in the Declarations, then for the reasons previously mentioned, the rate/rule manual must be updated as the limit cannot appear only in the Declarations (note the submitted Declarations does not include this limit). Based on the above, if the limit for the World-Wide Coverage is the Coverage C limit, then either of the following would be acceptable: (1) Update the World-Wide Coverage in the form to remove the reference to ""the percentage shown in your Policy Declarations of"" so the first sentence states ""We will pay up to the Coverage C limit"". With this option no updates need to be made to the rate/rule manual. (2) If you do not wish to amend the endorsement, then please update either Rule G4.

File #20-0070). In the Safeco filing, under the 9/17/2020 objection #2 and the 11/18/2020 objection #1, we requested an explanation as to why the company replaced ISO language that is standard language under the Mortgage Clause. We also asked the intent of the revised wording. In response, Safeco updated the paragraph for consistency with ISO's Mortgage Clause. As the proposed policy form includes the same language initially proposed under paragraph f for Safeco, we are requesting the language be revised  for consistency with Safeco/ISO or for an explanation as to why the ISO language was replaced and the intent of the revised wording and additional language regarding a partial assignment of the mortgage. Below is the objection sent for Safeco's Homeowners program on 11/18/2020 under SERFF Tracking #LBPM-132210987 (Dept. File #20-0070). Objection #1 on 11/18/2020: Please note you did not respond to all of our questions under objection #2 in the 9/17/20 objection letter. The objection mentioned the standard language under the Mortgage Clause states that if the insurer pays the mortgagee for any loss and denies payment to the insured, then ""at our option, we may pay to the mortgagee the whole principal on the mortgage plus any accrued interest. In this event, we shall receive a full assignment and transfer of the mortgage and all securities held as collateral to the mortgage debt."" Please note Safeco has replaced this language with the following: ""at our option, we shall receive full or partial assignment and transfer of the mortgage and all securities held as collateral to the mortgage debt as our payment, including any accrued interest, as it bears to the amount of the principal on the mortgage."" Our objection asked for an explanation as to why Safeco replaced the ISO language and to explain the intent of the revised wording and the intent of the additional language regarding partial assignment of the mortgage.

One issue with the approach of applying AAL is that even if a few of the 100,000 simulated years are extreme outliers, they could skew the mean far to the right and beyond any level of wildfire loss that could be reasonably anticipated to occur in Nevada in the proximate future. Has the company considered truncating the distribution of estimates from the simulation to eliminate extreme outliers that would skew the mean in this way? If not, why not? Furthermore, while the AAL itself may not incorporate a return-period assumption, the numerical value of the AAL will fall somewhere between the numerical values for two return periods (X) and (X+1). What is the value of X?

(b) The theft peril (PC 9) trend data in Exhibit 7.2 shows a largely decreasing trend outside of the pandemic, however even during the pandemic, the actual paid pure premium never rose above half of the highest pure premium which occurred in the year ending 9/2018. The selected trend of -5.0% is higher than any of the regression outcomes and does not appear supported by the exhibit. (ii) The projected severity trends for the weather perils appear to reflect temporary increases in severity during the pandemic which are not reasonable to project into the future, and as such appear to be insufficiently supported. Please provide explanations for the selected projected severity trends for the perils below. (a) For the water perils (PC 4 and 5), the projected severity trend is 10% (Exhibit 10.1), however Exhibit 11.1 shows that the increases of Actual Paid Severity Annual Change since the height of the pandemic has decreased significantly and continues to be well below 5%. This is reflected in the 6 pt regression outcome. As such, it does not appear reasonable for the selected severity trend to be applied for the prospective period. (b) For the wind and hail perils (PC 6 and 7), the severity trend is 9%, however Exhibit 11.2 shows that the Annual Change is trending downward as reflected in the 6 pt regression outcome. While a positive severity trend may be appropriate, it does not appear appropriate for the projected severity trend to be as high as 9%. (iii) The company states that Premium Component 3 (Wildfire) premium is 3.2% of total premium at current rates, however the company received a 245.0% rate increase for this peril in its most recent filing. Please verify whether this 3.2% incorporates the premium increase from filing 108363 in its reference to current rates. (iv) Please provide the calculation of the Wildfire Provision Per AIY Including LAE of 0.416 as expressed in exhibit 27 of Attachment IV.

For the projected loss trends, you are selecting the average of the 12- and 16-point statistics rather than the average of the 3- and 4-point statistics. We do not see why this should be considered appropriate for projected loss trends. Please revise your selections to be consistent with the methodology used in your previous filing. (We note that these changes, in conjunction with the premium trend changes, result in large indications despite taking nearly the full indication in your previous filing from just a few months ago. For example, with only two additional quarters of loss experience, your Landlords Rental Dwelling rate level has gone from an indication of +21.8% and a proposed change of +21.0% in your previous filing to a +86.7% indication in this filing. This does not seem reasonable. We strongly suggest that you revise your exhibits to use an approach consistent with your previous filing.)",2025-02-24
