Service\ncontracts are regulated under different laws under Title 20 regulations and require the obligor to obtain a permit to engage in the\nservice contract business. Additionally, a service contract requires a separate consideration from the one for an insurance contract.\nThere must be a clear distinction between the two types of coverage and how each affects consumers rights and obligations.\nPursuant to ARS 20-1095 et seq. an entity issuing service contracts needs to obtain a permit in order to do so. Issuing service\ncontracts without the appropriate registration constitutes an unlicensed activity and is prohibited by law.\nAdditionally, combining two disassociated coverages within the same policy without notice that the consumer is entering into two\nseparate coverage contracts causes consumer harm and confusion and is in violation of Arizonas Unfair Practices Act. See ARS 20-\n443, 461. An insurance policy coverage is distinct and separate from the ones of a service contract and each can affect a consumers\nrights and obligations differently.\nIn this case, Farmers Insurance Company of Arizona and Policy Form 93-7726 and any other forms that contain similar coverages,\ndoes not comply with the statutory provisions cited above. The company does not hold a service company permit and is not\nauthorized to sell service contracts in Arizona. Furthermore, the current form filing includes both insurance coverage and service\ncontract coverage within the same form without any explanations or information relating to the differences between the two coverages\nwhich will cause consumer confusion. Any claims under an insurance policy are treated differently from those under a service\ncontract and the implications for a consumer under each coverage are very distinct. Without clearly explaining the differences and\nproviding sufficient information to a consumer to make a well-informed decision, the current form language misrepresents pertinent\nfacts and insurance policy provisions relating to coverage.\nThe Department objects to the current form language. This filing will remain open until such time as this language is removed.  In\naddition any related Rate or Rule filings will need to be revised or withdrawn.

File\n#20-0070).\nObjection #1 on 11/18/2020:\nPlease note you did not respond to all of our questions under objection #2 in the 9/17/20 objection letter.\nThe objection mentioned the standard language under the Mortgage Clause states that if the insurer pays the mortgagee for any loss\nand denies payment to the insured, then\n\"at our option, we may pay to the mortgagee the whole principal on the mortgage plus any accrued interest. In this event, we shall\nreceive a full assignment and transfer of the mortgage and all securities held as collateral to the mortgage debt.\"\nPlease note Safeco has replaced this language with the following:\n\"at our option, we shall receive full or partial assignment and transfer of the mortgage and all securities held as collateral to the\nmortgage debt as our payment, including any accrued interest, as it bears to the amount of the principal on the mortgage.\"\nOur objection asked for an explanation as to why Safeco replaced the ISO language and to explain the intent of the revised wording\nand the intent of the additional language regarding partial assignment of the mortgage.

The selected trend of -5.0% is higher than any of the regression outcomes and does not appear supported by the exhibit.\n(ii) The projected severity trends for the weather perils appear to reflect temporary increases in severity during the pandemic which\nare not reasonable to project into the future, and as such appear to be insufficiently supported. Please provide explanations for the\nselected projected severity trends for the perils below.\n(a) For the water perils (PC 4 and 5), the projected severity trend is 10% (Exhibit 10.1), however Exhibit 11.1 shows that the\nincreases of Actual Paid Severity Annual Change since the height of the pandemic has decreased significantly and continues to be\nwell below 5%. This is reflected in the 6 pt regression outcome. As such, it does not appear reasonable for the selected severity trend\nto be applied for the prospective period.\n(b) For the wind and hail perils (PC 6 and 7), the severity trend is 9%, however Exhibit 11.2 shows that the Annual Change is trending\ndownward as reflected in the 6 pt regression outcome. While a positive severity trend may be appropriate, it does not appear\nappropriate for the projected severity trend to be as high as 9%.\n(iii) The company states that Premium Component 3 (Wildfire) premium is 3.2% of total premium at current rates, however the\ncompany received a 245.0% rate increase for this peril in its most recent filing. Please verify whether this 3.2% incorporates the\npremium increase from filing 108363 in its reference to current rates.\n(iv) Please provide the calculation of the Wildfire Provision Per AIY Including LAE of 0.416 as expressed in exhibit 27 of Attachment\nIV. This calculation should show the AAL output of the Verisk Wildfire Model (adjusted to exclude non-renewing policies) and any\nintermediary figures which are used to arrive at the final figure.",
