        "filing_description": "The Hartford Personal Lines respectfully submits for your approval the enclosed Homeowners rate filing for a +16.5% overall\nrate change on a California Department of Insurance (CDI) Maximum indication of +21.9%. The last Home Advantage AARP\nProgram rate change was effective 10/19/20 (State Tracking # 20-716), and the “Mitigation in Rating Plans Regulation” filing\nwas approved and effective 9/3/24 (State Tracking # 23-1131).\nThe Hartford introduced by peril rating with the introduction of the Home Advantage class plan in April 2012. Coverage for all\nspecified perils is included in our homeowners product (i.e. no peril coverage is optional). With the introduction of by peril rating\nwe have been monitoring loss performance and have deemed it necessary to adjust the Building and Tenant form rates.  We\nhave seen increased loss ratios from Wildfire since this rate plan was introduced. This proposed change will attempt to\nbalance the Building form loss ratios across perils closer to the overall state loss ratio. The overall Building forms rate increase\nwill be +17.3%. For Tenant we are adjusting the rate uniformly across perils by -4.9%, and for Condo we are adjusting the rate\nuniformly across perils by +10.4%.\nThe CDI template methodology used to support the catastrophe adjustment factors is based on a 20-year historical average as\nshown on supporting Exhibit 9. At this time, we are proposing a rate increase within the maximum indication based on the CDI\ntemplate methodology. Our view of rate need, when following standard industry practices of using catastrophe models and\nreflecting reinsurance costs, produces a materially higher view of rate need than the CDI template.\nThe trend selections by form consider both loss and premium trends and are based on the most appropriate net trend of the\nfive possible point fits (8, 12, 16, 20, and 24). Form level trend explanations are included in supporting Exhibit 8.",
