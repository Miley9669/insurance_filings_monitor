(b) The expense provisions included in the rates to be used by an insurer may reflect the operating methods of the insurer, or group of insurers, and, so far as it is credible, its own expense experience. (c) Risks may be classified in any reasonable way for the establishment of rates and minimum premiums, except that no classification may be based on race, color, creed or national origin and classifications in automobile insurance may not be based on physical disability of an insured. &#8194;Rates thus produced may be modified for individual risks in accordance with rating plans, schedules, individual risk premium modification plans and expense reduction plans that establish reasonable standards for measuring probable variations in experience, hazards, expenses or any combination of those factors. Such standards shall permit recognition of expected differences in loss or expense characteristics, and shall be designed so that such plans are reasonable and equitable in their application, and are not unfairly discriminatory, violative of public policy or otherwise contrary to the best interests of the people of this state. This section shall not prevent the development of new or innovative rating methods which otherwise comply with this act. (d) Rates may be modified for individual risks, upon written application of the insured, stating the insured's reasons therefore, filed with and not disapproved by the commissioner within 10 days after filings. (e) The rates may contain provisions for contingencies and an allowance permitting a reasonable profit. &#8194;In determining the reasonableness of the profit, consideration shall be given to the investment income attributable to the line of insurance.""",2025-03-03

For example, if the customer had 50/100 prior to 11/17/2024, they would be rated with code B and this will not change to code A at renewal (even if they renew after 11/17/2024). Therefore, an insured would not experience a premium increase at renewal for this variable as a result of this change. For this reason the rule of application in the filing is only applicable to New Business and states there is a 0% impact. "" It is the position of the Bureau that if prior BI limits are used and the insured increases or decreases those limits, the homeowners rating must be adjusted accordingly. Amend the rule to clarify the same.",2025-03-03
