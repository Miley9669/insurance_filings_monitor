For example, if the\ncustomer had 50/100 prior to 11/17/2024, they would be rated with code B and this will not change to code A at renewal (even if they\nrenew after 11/17/2024). Therefore, an insured would not experience a premium increase at renewal for this variable as a result of\nthis change. For this reason the rule of application in the filing is only applicable to New Business and states there is a 0% impact. \"\nIt is the position of the Bureau that if prior BI limits are used and the insured increases or decreases those limits, the homeowners\nrating must be adjusted accordingly. Amend the rule to clarify the same.",
